2022-06-21,"Banks holding on to subsidy share, say payments firms","The companies have written to the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI), complaining that â‚¹700 crore of the â‚¹1,500 crore granted in the budget is being retained by banks.","ReutersPayments companies and banks are at loggerheads over the sharing of government-granted subsidies for building payment infrastructure, said three people with knowledge of the matter. 

The companies have written to the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI), complaining that â‚¹700 crore of the â‚¹1,500 crore granted in the budget is being retained by banks, they said. This has deprived companies connecting up the last mile of state-promised revenues, according to them. The government granted the subsidies in exchange for waiving Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) charges.

""The government has released â‚¹700 crore worth of subsidies to banks but they are not sharing it with any payment aggregators,"" said the CEO of a payments company on condition of anonymity.


Compensation for MDR Waiver 
 ""We have taken up the matter with NPCI, which is the nodal agency but the feedback that we got is that we should take the matter up with respective banks, but they are not responding.""

Last year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a Rs 1,500 crore fund to hasten the expansion of India's digital payments industry, a move that was seen as compensating for the waiver of MDR on the use of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay cards in her previous budget.

 Payment aggregators are entitled to receive a 15 basis point subvention on small-value digital transactions. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.




""We have asked all banks for whom we process transactions on the RuPay debit cards--they are not sharing any subsidy amount with us,"" said another CEO. ""Payment aggregators put in so much effort to acquire transactions on the RuPay platform when most banks were either surrendering these cards or going slow on expansion.""

Banks didn't respond to queries on the matter.

Currently, the cost of digital payment services such as switching fees or interchange fees is borne by one or more of the payment system participants or is passed on to merchants through the MDR or ultimately levied on the customer as additional charges.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it will carry out a comprehensive review of all aspects related to charges involved in various channels of digital payments in the recently released Payments Vision 2025 document.

""We believe this review could result in relatively higher credit card and wallet MDRs and the introduction of MDR on UPI to at least cover the cost,"" said Anand Dama, senior research analyst, Emkay Global.

While the adoption of electronic payments has surged, concerns abound over viability. Total digital payments rose 216% and 10% in terms of volume and value, respectively, in March from the year earlier, according to RBI data.

On the other hand, usage of paper instruments such as cheques declined significantly during the period, with their share in total retail payments registering a decline from 3.83% to 0.88% in terms of volume and from 19.62% to 11.47% in terms of value.",Negative
2022-04-19,Digitally ready Bank of Baroda aims to click on more loans,"At present, 50% of the bank's retail loans are sourced digitally. Out of this, 97% of the bank's personal loans are disbursed end-to-end digitally while the bulk of the home loan originations is done digitally. ","AgenciesThe bank presently has 20 million active users on its mobile app, with plans to reach 30 million customers in a year's time.After overhauling its IT infrastructure to set up digital banking departments internally, public sector lender Bank of Baroda is now targeting at least 65% of retail originations and 35% of MSME loans (value-wise) to be done digitally by the end of the current fiscal year. The bank is also targeting â‚¹50,000 crore of digital lending in the current fiscal year.

""We believe that this year we will disburse loans of over â‚¹50,000 crore through our digital bank this year alone,"" said Akhil Handa, chief digital officer, Bank of Baroda. ""This will be a combination of retail (home, auto, personal) loans and small ticket MSME loans (Mudra loans and small ticket business loans). We have a substantial advantage over peer banks that are getting started with their digital journey.""

Handa added that at least â‚¹35,000 crore-â‚¹40,000 crore will come from lending to the retail sector, while the balance will be contributed by the MSME segment.

At present, 50% of the bank's retail loans are sourced digitally. Out of this, 97% of the bank's personal loans are disbursed end-to-end digitally while the bulk of the home loan originations is done digitally. About 90% of all new retail accounts were done digitally. ""About 65% of retail and 35% of MSME will be digital this year. Our thrust is on the personal loan product and looking at the present run rate that alone will help us reach our lending goal,"" Handa said.

The public sector lender is also aiming to onboard 25% of new retail customers through mobile banking and book 25% of its deposits through this mode.

Last year, the bank rolled out a digital lending department that will digitise half of its â‚¹6.4 lakh crore balance sheet, including retail, MSME and agriculture. The bank expects the move toward digitisation would help it bring down the cost of operations by 25%.

Recently, the Bank launched 'bob World', its all-new digital banking platform, which is aimed at providing an all-inclusive and seamless virtual banking experience.

The bank presently has 20 million active users on its mobile app, with plans to reach 30 million customers in a year's time. It's aiming that nearly 50% of its non-financial inclusion customers will use this app as a primary interface. ""Our market share of mobile banking application downloads is 11.5% which is twice our market share of retail customer deposits, which is 5.5-6%,"" Handa said.

Karnataka is at the forefront in attracting investments and the WEF Meet has proved to be a ""success"", he said, as he asserted that the State has ""not lost or is not going to lose"" in attracting investments in the backdrop of such concerns citing certain developments locally. 

""Investment commitments worth Rs 60,000 crore-65,000 crore are expected to flow into the State after our discussions with about 25 companies during the Davos meet,"" Bommai said. 

Speaking to reporters after returning from Davos, he said the investments are a proof of the immense trust and faith Karnataka enjoys, especially with regard to its technology base, skilled manpower, among the top corporates of the world. 

""They are of the opinion that Karnataka is the destination for investment in new technologies...the government is committed to ensuring implementation of these investment commitments with an end-to-end approach,"" he said, adding that all these projects would be sanctioned in six months and it may take one to two years for realisation, while renewable energy related ones would take 5-7 years. 

The government is expecting a good response to its Global Investors' Meet to be held in Bengaluru in November and the Bengaluru Tech Summit after this Davos meet. 

To a question about neighbouring Andhra Pradesh claiming a higher investment of Rs 1,25,000 crore investment, Bommai said Karnataka cannot be compared with any other States, as the State has international standards and is attracting investment from companies of similar standards. 

""We will also have similar numbers, for example Adani group has committed a project worth Rs 50,000 crore, but they have not signed an MoU, but they have committed. Also, we have had investments in important areas of the future like hydrogen fuels, semiconductor, defence, aerospace,"" he said, adding that he has explained to business leaders including Lakshmi Mittal (Executive Chairman of ArcelorMittal) about 'Ease of Doing Business' policy of Karnataka. 

Detailing about investment proposals, the Chief Minister said ReNew Power Pvt. Ltd, has signed an MoU for an investment of Rs 50,000 crore spread over the next seven years for setting up renewable energy, battery storage, green hydrogen units with employment opportunities for about 30,000 people. 

The company intends to implement the projects in two phases, he said.

Further noting that the Hero group has discussed setting up EV manufacturing, the Chief Minister said, ""We have asked them to consider the north Karnataka region and we will provide incentives."" 

Under the 'Beyond Bengaluru' programme, the State government discussed investment opportunities in cities like Tumakuru, Hubli-Dharwad, and Mysuru. 

""Ab InBev"" intends to set up a non-alcoholic beverages unit in the State with an investment of Rs 50 crore, while Nestle is set to expand and modernise its existing Instant Coffee unit in Nanjangud with an investment of Rs 700 crore.

The EPFO had declared an interest rate of 8.1% for FY22 at its central board of trustees meeting last month.","Getty ImagesThe budget for FY22 had imposed income-tax on interest earned on subscriber contributions of more than â‚¹2.5 lakh a year.The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) hasn't yet been able to split subscriber accounts into two for members who contributed more than â‚¹2.5 lakh last fiscal, which may create tax complications and filing issues, experts said. The EPFO is likely to split accounts only at the time of crediting the interest for FY22, which generally happens between September and December of the following fiscal year, they added. The EPFO had declared an interest rate of 8.1% for FY22 at its central board of trustees meeting last month.

The budget for FY22 had imposed income-tax on interest earned on subscriber contributions of more than â‚¹2.5 lakh a year. 

Since income-tax returns are required to be filed by July 31, this may create issues if taxpayers are not aware of the taxable interest earned on provident fund contributions. 

As per the plan, existing provident fund (PF) accounts with an employee contribution of over â‚¹2.5 lakh were to be split into two from April 1, 2022. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had inserted Rule 9D in the Income-Tax Rules, 1962, which specified that two separate accounts within the PF account shall be maintained to segregate the taxable and non-taxable contributions to PF along with the interest paid.




There is still a lack of clarity on the details of how this is to be done.

The EPFO did not respond to a query from ET on the possible delay.

""Organisations with PF trusts, which have the obligation of withholding tax, have started discussing it but await clarity from the EPFO on how to go about it as segregated accounts are not yet in place,"" said Saraswathi Kasturirangan, partner, Deloitte India. This may happen at the time of crediting of interest for the previous fiscal, he said.

A top government official told ET that the EPFO is in advanced stages of developing the system and it could be effective anytime as the retirement fund body starts accounting for the previous year. Those with a basic salary of about â‚¹21 lakh or more would fall under this net as their 12% contribution would exceed â‚¹2.5 lakh. Voluntary contributions by employees would also be counted toward this limit.

The bilateral pact, officially dubbed as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) is expected to increase the bilateral trade in goods to over USD 100 billion and trade in services to over USD 15 billion within five years. 

 It came into effect from May 1. 

 The agreement opens the door for many sectors, particularly labour-intensive ones such as textiles, gem and jewellery, pharmaceuticals and agriculture, Goyal said while briefing the media along with the UAE Minister for Economy Abdullah Bin Touq Al Marri here. 

 The ministers launched 'India-UAE Start-up Bridge' at the India-UAE Partnership Summit, organised by industry body CII here. 

 ""Clearly millions of jobs will be added if our exports which are now at about USD 36 billion, which is about nearly Rs 2.5 lakh crore, grows as we are planning. And my own guess estimate is this partnership can finally go up to about USD 250 billion of bilateral trade on both sides. 

 ""So my sense is that this will give a big boost to economic growth, to jobs. And the opportunities it opens not only in the UAE, but in the larger ground for the African region. (It) should significantly give a bump up to the Indian economy as well,"" Goyal said. 

 He added that the pact would not only open doors for Indian businesses to UAE but also to other countries as UAE is a transit point for large parts of Africa, CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, and the Gulf region. 

 CIS countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Tajikistan. 

 Further, Goyal said that Indian pharma products will get immediate access to the UAE market and ""we believe (bilateral) trade will grow to at least to USD 100 billion in the near future....Our own commitment is to take it to a much higher level"" 

 According to the minister, the framework is expected to add a million jobs in India and provide opportunities to the startup ecosystem in the country and has huge potential for engagement on skill development and education. 

 ""We are looking at significant investments as the UAE has committed over USD 100 billion of investments into India in manufacturing, infrastructure, (and) service (s). So the business will get a booster shot,"" the minister said. 

 He informed that there are a large number of startups which have emerged in the last six years, with more than 65,000 registered with the ministry. 

 India also has over 100 unicorns with the third largest startup ecosystem in the world, he said. 

 The UAE minister said the pact will add 1.7 per cent GDP growth to their economy. 

 He also said the agreement is not just on products and commodities but also into services, adding that there are other opportunities that can come along. 

 ""Now, the growth that we're looking at, that we want to reach USD-100 billion dollars from USD 40 billion or so today, in the next decade... Our economic modelling showed that this is an opportunity of growth, it can actually reach that number,"" the minister said.

Indian Tea Association has sought the help of the Assam government for appropriate measures to protect life and livelihood in that region.

Barak Valley tea Industry which has historically been suffering from several traditional problems is also reeling under severe economic crisis due to long recessionary conditions.

Owing to incessant rainfall since the first week of May, the whole of Barak Valley is in the grip of severe floods. All the rivers which are reportedly flowing much above the danger level have caused erosion in several areas apart from submerging several towns of that region including Silchar, the main hub of activities.

The latest move comes days after WhatsApp won regulatory approval to more than double its payments offering to 100 million users in India, its biggest market with more than half a billion users overall.

WhatsApp will before the end of May launch the cashback offer of up to 33 Indian rupees ($0.40) for transfers users make on its payments service, which allows contacts to send each other funds from within the messenger app, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the company's plans.

The incentive, spread over three transactions, will be given irrespective of the amount being transferred, even if it is as little as 1 Indian rupee, in what one source described as WhatsApp's ""user acquisition drive.""

The WhatsApp cashback amount may appear small, but Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, said it would be a ""compelling enough"" reason for users to switch.

""You won't leave money on the table as an Indian,"" Shah said.

In a statement responding to a question from Reuters, WhatsApp said it is ""running a campaign offering cashback incentives in a phased manner to our users as a way to unlock the potential of payments on WhatsApp.""

Separately, in a broader payments push, WhatsApp is testing a programme where it will dole out cashback incentives for users who pay highway tolls and utility and other bills straight from the app, the two sources said.

WhatsApp also wants to test such incentives for those making mobile payments for Reliance Jio, India's biggest telecom operator, the sources said. Reliance is a partner of WhatsApp whose parent Meta Platforms Inc in 2020 invested $5.7 billion in the Indian firm's digital arm.

WhatsApp did not comment on these plans, while Reliance didn't respond to a request for comment.

The cashback push comes after WhatsApp in June 2021 conducted an internal study to assess competition in India. Seen by Reuters, the ""Winning from behind on India payments,"" study says ""incentives are among the top sign up reasons for our competitor apps"" in India.

WhatsApp also assessed it needs to go beyond peer-to-peer payments as users use rival apps to make merchant and bill payments which, the study stated, will be a ""more attractive proposition (for users) to switch over"" to WhatsApp.

WhatsApp competes with Alphabet Inc's Google Pay, Ant Group-backed Paytm and Walmart's PhonePe in India's crowded digital payments market.

WhatsApp's growth has been hamstrung as India has for months capped the number of users to which it can offer its payments service on fears that opening it to all its users could strain the country's financial infrastructure, Reuters has reported.

India also stuck to its tough stand on fisheries subsidies, demanding that rich nations presently providing not-specific fuel subsidies must be subjected to some kind of discipline.

Speaking at the Plenary Session of the 12th Ministerial Conference of WTO in Geneva on Sunday, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said the WTO should not negotiate rules on non-trade-related subjects like climate change and gender, which legitimately fall within the domain of other inter-governmental organisations.

His statement assumes significance in the wake of decisions on plurilaterals on the environment, gender and MSMEs making their way into the draft outcome of the WTO MC12 despite many countries opposed to such initiatives.

Goyal said the humanitarian crisis triggered by spiraling food inflation is a ""matter of deep concern"" and the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the need and efficacy of food stockholding for the public good.



""Fighting for rights of our farmers within an hour of landing at WTO, Geneva at the G33 Ministerial Meeting. Discussed prospects of a permanent solution to public stockholding for food security with DG Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and my counterparts from developing and least developed nations,"" Goyal tweeted.

Goyal made it clear that the country will not buckle under pressure from the developed world to sign any agreement, including the one on fisheries subsidies, during the June 12-15 global trade meet as the new text of the draft pact sent for consideration to the ministers has failed to address its concerns.

At the plenary, he also said that India ramped up supplies of medical products to provide medical and health items globally but the WTO could not respond with alacrity. ""The rich countries need to introspect. We need to bow our head in shame for our inability to respond to the pandemic,"" Goyal said. ""We have let down the people of the LDCs and developing countries.""

Goyal said the rights of Indian fishermen and women cannot be curtailed in any manner.

""On the contrary, those nations responsible for depleted fish-stock should assume responsibility, having exploited the oceans for far too long by giving subsidies,"" he said.

In reply to ET's question on whether the much-awaited fisheries subsidies pact can go through in the backdrop of India's stiff opposition, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, ""We will try our best to get the fisheries subsidies agreement through. We know we are in a good stage. But whatever happens I want you to know we have made so much progress that we are going to land it either now or later (MC13),"" hinting at the possibility of searching for a solution only by the next ministerial.

India introduced a component on deep sea vessels for traditional fishermen only in 2020-21 under its flagship Rs 20,050-crore PM Matsya Sampada Yojana.

While reiterating that New Delhi is keen to finalise the pact to end irrational subsidies and overfishing, India is making it clear that to achieve sustainability, big fishing subsidisers (for instance EU, US, China, Japan et al) must take greater responsibility to curtail subsidies and their fishing capacities.

The other formal negotiations scheduled during the four-day-long MC12 include WTO's response to the pandemic, including a waiver of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); food security - both subjects being scheduled for June 13; fisheries subsidies and agriculture on June 14, and finally, WTO reforms and ecommerce on June 15.


G33, Bilaterals

At the G33 ministerial meeting, he called upon the G-33 group of developing countries work collectively and reach out to other like-minded nations to secure their support in getting a fair, balanced and development-centric outcome at the WTO which must include a permanent solution for the public stockholding and special safeguard mechanism. The G33 group includes 47 developing and least developed countries.

The minister said that the two items primarily on the agenda this time are a solution to public stockholding and the special safeguard mechanism to address the destabilising and crippling effects of import surges and downward price movement largely due to huge subsidies by the developed nations.

â€œIt is the timing which came as a surprise to many, but the act people thought should have been done anyway â€” to what extent could have varied,â€ she said at The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence that was held in Mumbai on Saturday evening. â€œIt came as a surprise because it came between two monetary policy reviews.â€

She noted that in the April policy review, RBI had indicated that it was time to act on inflation.

Sitharaman was presented with the ET Award for Business Reformer for having guided the Indian economy through the most turbulent times in recent history, at a glittering ceremony attended by top ministers and bureaucrats as well as the cream of the Indian industry.

RBI raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years on May 4, following an unscheduled policy review to rein in prices.

The finance minister also said it makes perfect sense to buy oil from Russia if itâ€™s being offered to India at a discounted rate, particularly with inflation on the rise globally. â€œI thought we have been spending a lot of time explaining Indiaâ€™s position, not just on the abstentions (on Ukraine) when voting took place (at the United Nations), but also on the fact that if Russia is offering it to us at a discounted rate, we will still be buying it because it makes perfect sense, particularly when the world is stressed out with inflation,â€ she said.


Best Interests Amid Inflation
Sitharaman said this was in the best interests of the nation when commodities prices are sending inflation higher. â€œI think we'll go ahead with what is good for the country. We need cheaper fuel. If it is available, why wonâ€™t we want to buy it? We will buy it,â€ she said.

The finance minister observed that she sees a greater understanding among central banks worldwide and that inflation in India isnâ€™t as much as it is in the US or the UK.

â€œBut still the challenge of recovery versus inflation seems to be following a particular template across the globe,â€ she said, adding that understanding how to handle the post-pandemic recovery is, therefore, not unique and typical just to India.


GST Rates
Sitharaman ruled out any major decision on rate rationalisation at the next Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting. â€œI want the media to please absorb everything that Iâ€™m saying â€” itâ€™s not happening in the next meeting obviously,â€ she said.

Once the rate panelâ€™s report on the issue was completed, it will be circulated in the council for discussion. â€œI would think that the committeeâ€™s report itself is not before me,â€ she said. â€œIt is too presumptuous for me to think itâ€™s going to happen in the next meeting.â€


Food, Fertiliser Subsidy
The food subsidy programme will continue as long as itâ€™s needed.

â€œWe did understand that till such a time as we are confident (of) recovery and are confident that the poor are able to stand up for themselves and earn their livelihood comfortably, we wanted to extend the food programme, for which the outer understanding of our limit (is) Rs 2.1-2.2 lakh crore. In a way, that calculation has been in our minds, and even during the budget preparation, that was well in our consideration zone,â€ she said.

The government is conscious the fertiliser subsidy may rise even this year, so farmers arenâ€™t burdened. â€œSo, to an extent, we were prepared for an additional allocation both for the (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan) Anna Yojana and also for the fertilisers,â€ Sitharaman said.


Crypto Assets
The minister said Indiaâ€™s stance on taxing crypto assets has been appreciated by multilateral agencies.

â€œThe concern in the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and in multilateral institutions is that because there is not enough regulatory mechanism, cryptos should not end up violating those FATF (Financial Action Task Force) norms,â€ said Sitharaman. â€œIndia took a step forward by taxing the crypto transactions and has been well receivedâ€¦ they see it as an out-of-box solution to tracking the money.â€

 The next round of negotiations will take place from June 27 till July 1 here. 

 India had started negotiations for a trade pact, dubbed the Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), with the 27-country economic bloc in 2007, but the talks stalled in 2013 as both sides failed to reach an agreement on key issues, including customs duties on automobiles and spirits, and the movement of professionals.

2022-06-09,Shaktikanta Das is getting his way on interest rates. But for how long?,"Fiscal dominance occurs when the govtâ€™s finances- for instance, the cost at which it borrows- take priority and force the monetary authorityâ€™s hand on interest rates, hurting its power to fight the inflation. ","Back in February, when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes. First, they said, there was a 15% probability that the central bank was right to ignore supply-side pressures. 

But their base case, to which they assigned a 50% likelihood, was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases. They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant 35% chance: that the RBI, although wrong about inflation, would simply go on to tolerate it. 

â€œThis is a scenario of fiscal dominance, in which policy rates rise by much less than we expect in 2022, but macro risks â€” both inflation and external â€” could be much higher than our current baseline,â€ Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi wrote in a Feb. 25 note. â€œWe see a potential stagflationary outcome in this scenario.â€

Fiscal dominance occurs when the governmentâ€™s finances â€” for instance, the cost at which it borrows â€” take priority and force the monetary authorityâ€™s hand on interest rates, hurting its power to fight inflation. That isnâ€™t the case in India right now. In early May, when the fiction of transient inflation became impossible to keep up, the Indian central bank surprised the market with an unscheduled 40 basis point increase in the benchmark interest rate. It followed up Wednesday by raising the policy rate by another 50 basis points, though this time the tightening was widely expected. For now, it doesnâ€™t look like the fiscal authority is keen to dissuade the central bank from doing its job.

At 7.8%, the pace of annual price increases is at an eight-year high and still climbing. In other words, itâ€™s early days in Indiaâ€™s battle against inflation, and the finance ministry might yet lose its nerve if, in the process of containing price pressures, the RBI pushes up bond yields too high, complicating the governmentâ€™s plan to raise money by selling a record 14.31 trillion rupees ($184 billion) of notes this year.

So far, the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesnâ€™t seem to be rattled. If anything, New Delhi has announced a $26 billion package, which includes tax cuts on fuel, to help the RBI keep a lid on inflation. That package is unlikely to be a substitute for more rate increases; it might even enlarge the public borrowing plan. To this, add Wednesday's increase in prices for monsoon-sown crops â€” including rice -- that the government will pay farmers to procure their harvests for public distribution. Money will have to be found for this, too.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has to assure New Delhi that its borrowing program would get completed without pushing the 10-year yield much higher than the current level of around 7.5%, a three-year high. The question is, can Das really hold the line on long-term bond yields? And will the government change its carefree tune if he canâ€™t. Luckily for Das, so far thereâ€™s been nothing of the 2015 bluster when, according to a recent Al Jazeera expose by The Reportersâ€™ Collective, the top bureaucrat in the finance ministry had internally sought an investigation into then Governor Raghuram Rajanâ€™s decision to keep interest rates high, by which he was allegedly helping â€œthe white manâ€ â€” shorthand for investors in rich nations â€” at the cost of domestic investment and growth.

After Rajanâ€™s 2016 decision to return to the University of Chicago, the friction carried over to his successor. Governor Urjit Patel came under pressure on everything from interest rates â€” which by now were being decided by a monetary policy committee â€” to his management of surging corporate bad debt and, finally, the question of whether the RBI had more capital than it needed. 

Patelâ€™s deputy was mocked for warning the government of the consequences of raiding the RBIâ€™s coffers. Following Patelâ€™s abrupt resignation in December 2018, his job went to Das, a former finance-ministry mandarin who had executed Modiâ€™s draconian currency ban in late 2016. A new period of peaceful coexistence between the fiscal and monetary authorities began, and gained momentum during the pandemic when such cooperation became the norm globally. 

But now, the pandemic is over, and new sources of friction are cropping up. On rate increases, the central bank and the finance ministry may be singing from the same hymn book, but the question of the RBIâ€™s capital is beginning to simmer, thanks to the lowest dividend the ministry has received from the RBI in a decade: a little less than $4 billion, or a third of last yearâ€™s payout.

Crucially, even this reduced dividend has been made possible by the central bank simultaneously selling $97 billion from its foreign-currency reserves in the spot market and buying $114 billion. Ignore the purchases. Each dollar thatâ€™s sold is valued its weighted average cost of acquisition in the past. Since that figure is lower than the current exchange rate, selling dollars for around 78 rupees today means a profit, which is then shared with New Delhi. Without this â€œactive conversion of revaluation gains into realized profits, the RBI would have required a net capital injection from the government,â€ according to Observatory Group analyst Ananth Narayan. 

A reduction in the balance sheet also helped rein in the RBIâ€™s capital requirement, and prevented its dividend from going to zero, Narayan says. That tug of war â€” whether RBI would give money to the government or tap it for funds â€” might remain in check once again if the central bankâ€™s assets donâ€™t swell this year, either. That may well be the case since thereâ€™s hardly any dollar inflow into India now, only outflow. Still, the RBIâ€™s economic capital, which according to Narayanâ€™s calculation has already dipped below the minimum 20.8% of assets set by a 2019 committee, is a mindless constraint. It would never have come about if the finance ministry didnâ€™t in the past lust after the RBIâ€™s capital. To have to depend on politicians for money isnâ€™t a good outcome for an institution that has to project its autonomy to make its war on inflation credible. 

Indiaâ€™s fragile government finances mean that the risk of fiscal dominance of monetary policy always lurks in the background. Right now, it isnâ€™t a big threat because inflation is giving an unexpected boost to the tax revenue. But as Nomuraâ€™s Nandi says, monetary tightening is â€œfar from the finishing line.â€ Barely two months into the job, Das cut rates in a surprise stimulus ahead of Modiâ€™s May 2019 re-election bid. That was then. Now that the cycle has turned, it will be interesting to see if the RBI chief can keep his political masters in good humor. Or if his relationship with the government â€” like that of his two predecessors â€” will also start to fray.

The manufacturing sector witnessed a 460% jump in FY22 as against 2019-20.

New investment and capex announcements by the private sector saw a 145% year-on-year rise in FY22 and 150% increase over FY20.

As per the report, while the increase was aided by mega project announcements especially in the steel sector, the number of projects announced also increased by 80% in FY22.

â€œThe growth was contributed by both traditional sectors like petrochemicals, steel, cement and automobiles, and new-age sectors like electronics, e-vehicles, data centers,â€ Goldman Sachs said in the report.

Contract awarding grew 55% on-year in FY22, and the manufacturing sector saw an increase of almost 135% as against the previous fiscal. â€œGrowth in awards for Infra has been decent as well, primarily driven by higher activity in the roads sector,â€ it said.

While tenders saw an increase over FY21, it said that compared to FY19, the overall tendering activity which is primarily for government orders, has been â€œflattishâ€ indicating lower levels of activity in the next few months from an award perspective.

March witnessed broad-based improvement in indicators (including diesel, petrol, electricity demand, container volumes and railway freight) compared to February and on the year-on-year basis.

â€œThe relatively strong March data drove low-to-mid-single-digit on-year growth on average for 4QFY22, despite the impact of Omicron and a tough base â€” a positive for our cement, EPC (engineering-procurement-construction), and port companies,â€ the investment banking company said.

Engineering goods exports remained strong in February at $9.4 billion, up 33% year-on-year.

2022-06-08,Gram Unnati helps Uttarakhand farmers adopt climate-compatible agriculture to save water," According to the United Nations, by 2050 more than five billion people could be affected by water scarcity. India, which constitutes 16% of the total world population, has access to a meagre 4% of the worldâ€™s water resources. The success of our pilot project in Uttarakhand will impact other farmers to shift towards climate compatible crops without having an impact on yield and returns.â€","At a time when economies across the world are finding ways for sustainable farming due to depleting groundwater levels, agri-tech solution company Gram Unnati worked closely with multiple stakeholders to help farmers in Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand save 4,000 liters of water per acre by bringing climate-compatible agriculture to over 5,000 acres of farmland. 

Gram Unnati worked closely with the local district administration, local maize processors, input companies, and lead farmers in a short span of 18 months prompting 2,000 farmers to switch to climate-compatible crops that are commercially viable as well. 

Aneesh Jain, CEO and Founder, Gram Unnati, said, â€œThe success of the project comes at a time when we are dealing with acute water shortage across the world. According to the United Nations, by 2050 more than five billion people could be affected by water scarcity. India, which constitutes 16% of the total world population, has access to a meagre 4% of the worldâ€™s water resources. The success of our pilot project in Uttarakhand will impact other farmers to shift towards climate compatible crops without having an impact on yield and returns.â€ 

Farmers of Udham Singh Nagar and adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh (Rampur, Bareilly, and Pilibhit) traditionally take up a short duration summer paddy crop after their Rabi harvest and before Kharif sowing. Based on research, Gram Unnati identified Maize as a reasonably remunerative substitute for summer paddy. Maize is not only a short-duration crop, requiring less water compared to paddy but is also known to bring higher returns. Its multiple utilities such as â€˜foodâ€™, â€˜fodderâ€™, and â€˜feedâ€™ help in de-risking farmers against potential low-demand situations. 

â€œThe pilot project was successful in moving 5,000 acres of land to spring maize, which resulted in substantial water savings of as much as 4,000 litres per acre. The crop also generated 25 percent higher yield on the same piece of land. This has emerged as a good example of â€˜more crop per dropâ€™. The project also contributed towards fulfilment of Sustainable Development Goals like reducing poverty, increasing agricultural productivity, judicious use of water, and sustainable production,â€ added Jain.

Jain said that the success of the project in Udham Singh Nagar has encouraged Gram Unnati to take up newer challenges.

â€œGram Unnati intends to scale up this intervention to 100,000 acres of Spring Maize in the next five years. Not only would this reduce dependency on groundwater resources, but it will also help in making agriculture more remunerative for the farmers and more sustainable for the environment,â€ Jain added. 

As agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water in India, the shift from high to low-intensity crops such as Maize, pulses, millets, oilseeds, etc. has the potential to significantly reduce farmersâ€™ dependence on rainwater/ irrigation, while helping in greater water conservation, enhancing farmersâ€™ capacity to better cope with climate change and in the long run making India more self-sufficient in these crops. 

It is estimated that out of total extractable groundwater available in India, 90% goes to agriculture annually to often support highly water-intensive crops like paddy, sugarcane, and wheat, sometimes in severely water stressed regions of the country. As many as 30% of districts in India have reported â€˜criticalâ€™ groundwater levels according to recent Central Ground Water Board data. The growing water crisis is being worsened by climate change with rising temperatures and uncertain rainfall patterns.

Fuel prices were up 34.52% on the year versus 31.50% in February. The food index rose 8.71 per cent in March compared to 8.47 per cent in February. The food index comprises food articles from primary articles and food products from manufactured products.

Food article inflation eased to 8.06 per cent in March compared to 8.2 per cent in February. Vegetable inflation slowed to 19.88 per cent in March from 26.93 per cent in February.

Inflation in crude petroleum and natural gas accelerated to 69.2 per cent in March from 46.14 per cent in February. 

""The high rate of inflation in March, 2022 is primarily due to rise in prices of crude petroleum and natural gas, mineral oils, basic metals, etc owing to disruption in global supply chain caused by Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" the govt release said.

The core WPI inflation hardened in March with a 2.2% sequential rise amid global supply disruptions caused by the protracted Russia-Ukraine war. 

""The core WPI recorded a broad-based and massive 2.2% jump in sequential terms in March 2022, a fallout of the geopolitical tensions, with the inflation rate rising to 10.9%.

The RBI has taken note of the rising inflation and shifted its focus on tackling rising prices and withdrawal of accommodation. 

It has also revised its inflation projection upwards to 5.7 per cent from 4.5 per cent earlier for FY23. The RBI takes into account the CPI or retail inflation and not the WPI-based inflation for arriving at monetary policy decisions.

The latest bid submission window is from April 20 to May 31.,"AgenciesThe government has eased the terms of the revenue sharing contract to attract investors to the latest bidding round of discovered small fields, which has dragged on for nearly a year since its launch.

The government launched the third bidding round of the discovered small fields last June but postponed the bid submission window several times due to lukewarm investor appetite. The latest bid submission window is from April 20 to May 31.

The government has made several changes to the model revenue sharing contract in the third round. The new contract slashes by three-fourths the penalty imposed on contractors for not completing the promised bid work programme. For each well not drilled in the deep water, the penalty has been slashed to $1.5 million from $6 million earlier. Similar reductions have been made for onshore and shallow water wells.

The contract has redefined 'arm's length sale', describing it as a transaction between buyer and seller-the two being not the same legal entity-that follows a transparent and competitive bidding process. The earlier definition of arm's length sale barred sale to an affiliate.

The contractor can now extend the 'development period' by a maximum of one year by paying a fee.

The contract also adds an obligation on the contractor to take possession of all wells and facilities within 12 months from the date of signing of the contract.

The contractor will now have nine months, instead of six months earlier, to submit to the management committee a detailed field development plan.

If the contractor starts commercial production during the development period, the government share of revenue until the end of the development period shall be at the rate of $5per barrel of oil and 20 cents per mmBtu of natural gas or the share quoted by the contractor at lower revenue point, or whichever is lower.

The rupee has hit a series of record lows this week and is within striking distance of the psychologically important 79-to-a-dollar level, as concerns around growth, portfolio outflows, high global crude prices and sustained inflation weigh.

To control the tumble, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has sold dollars in the spot market and simultaneously bought and sold in the forwards market.

However, traders say the RBI's actions in the onshore forwards market have led premiums to crash sharply with the 1-year annualised forward premium now below 3%, levels last seen in November 2011, wiping out carry trade gains and pressuring the spot rupee price lower.

""Maturing forward contracts are suspected to be weighing on the currency this week, besides an unsupportive macro backdrop of a portfolio outflows, high oil and bid dollar,"" said Radhika Rao, senior economist with DBS Bank.

Those technical conditions have made forward market intervention a less-than-ideal tool for managing rupee volatility and left the RBI with fewer options to reduce the risks of capital flight.

SPOT MARKET INTERVENTION
RBI could make greater use of spot market intervention - which would run down central bank reserves - or may just opt to let the rupee weaken according to macroeconomic fundamentals.

""In the short-term, intervention strategy might return to the spot to meet dollar demand, in light of a sharp fall in forward premiums,"" Rao said.

At $590.6 billion, the reserves give RBI enough firepower to halt the slide in the currency but it is unlikely to intervene aggressively against fundamentals.

The rupee was market-determined, but the RBI would not allow ""runaway depreciation"" in the currency, its chief Shaktikanta Das said last month.

The rupee has held up relatively better than its Asian peers on account of the central bank intervention but with a widening trade and current account deficit (CAD) and sustained foreign portfolio outflows, the downward pressure has intensified.

""We believe INR could weaken towards 81 to a dollar before the end of FY23,"" QuantEco Research said in a note.

Falling FX reserves, persistently high commodity prices, limited exchange rate pass-through to inflation and elevated INR valuations will likely tilt the balance towards a less interventionist FX policy in the coming months, Madhavi Arora, senior economist at Emkay Global said.

""Allowing INR to gently weaken over time is the right strategy, giving CAD space to improve,"" Arora said.

Governor Das said it is for the NBFCs to make their own choice and the central bank after having created a broad framework does not have a role in it. ""Given the scale-based regulations for NBFCs which is now introduced and given our current status with regard to the bank licensing policy, it is for large NBFCs to take their own commercial decisions about their future, whether they want to continue as it is...we have no problem with that because the regulations provide for that.

Practicing sustainability is about being consciously aware of how one's life affects the community and working towards overall well-being.","ThinkStock PhotosIn every vertical of sustainability, be it food, clothing, housing, or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context.Sustainability has imploded as an agenda with unprecedented scope and significance. India's movement for a Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) is now in the global spotlight as a premier initiative for nurturing a ""pro planet people"". It is emerging as a consciously tailored policy for climate change focusing on reducing consumption at an individual level. Embers of LiFE already exist in the country, and there is much to learn from India's environmental history. Understanding the pivotal role of indigenous knowledge systems in preserving ecology is essential for shaping the future of Indian sustainability. Hence, the call for LiFE is about taking a walk down the memory lane, drawing lessons for India's future and implementing it on a larger scale. India has also revised its starting point from state action to individual action. Now the question is, what kind of individual action will create long-standing sustainability in the country? How can we chart a new course for Indian environmentalism through indigenous knowledge and experiences from the ground? The answer is simple; launching movements from the ground and mainstreaming indigenous practices but building momentum for the same is not an easy task.

Each country will play to its strengths to achieve ambitious targets, and India should also tap into its rich body of indigenous knowledge. There is no one ideal way to practice sustainability in the country. India has diverse physical and social divisions. The history, experience, and expectations of sustainability in Meghalaya will significantly differ from Kerala's. The first step is toward building environmental literacy within communities. When we talk about changing individual behaviour and lifestyle for the environment, it must be noted that the individual and the collective are closely entwined for preserving the environment. Practicing sustainability is about being consciously aware of how one's life affects the community and working towards overall well-being.

In every vertical of sustainability, be it food, clothing, housing, or resource conservation India already has a rich repository of practices evolved for a particular context. In 2021, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation recognised eight sustainable food systems worldwide, out of which two are from Meghalaya and Uttarakhand in India. The Khasi tribes from Nongtraw village in Meghalaya received global attention for their diverse traditional food systems like Jhum supported by livestock farming and other practices that respect local agro-biodiversity. This enabled the village to produce and consume quality yield even with supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19. Similarly, the Bhotias and Anwals of Uttrakhand follow ancestral nomadism and agro-pastoralism, which helps them meet 60% of the community's food consumption needs. This shows how traditional practices can build resilience in communities and aid climate adaptation efforts. We can also take the example of Indian architecture. The country is now rife with green building consultants, but historically, every part of the country had its locally suited green buildings. Dhajji Dewri in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, and Kashmir are traditional structures built by partially cutting mountain slopes. It is best suited for the region's climatic variations while causing minimal disturbance to the topography. Today it is impossible to travel to the mountains without considering the possibility of landslides and rocks hurling down due to reckless practices. This is only a sneak peek into India's depths of sustainable knowledge.

Finally, the only way to build a long-standing climate policy is by tapping into the strength of the grassroots and understanding the extent to which environmental movements can empower individuals on the ground. Chipko movement received global attention and is a landmark in the Indian environmental movement, but the starting point was at the community level. A social and yet personal struggle of Chandi Prasad Bhatt to preserve the local forest resources, escaped, connected, and thrived under the umbrella of eco feminism and peasant's movement in the country. If we look at the history of environmental movements in India, be it Narmada Bachao Andolan or the Niyamgiri movement, the first call for action always comes from the ground, from a personal anecdote, because fear is not thrilling when you're the one who is afraid. Also, the unique potential for LiFE lies in the fact that all humans, all Indians, are embedded and nurtured on the same earth. Besides, with increasing mobility and interconnectedness, we know the extent to which a tropical cyclone in Odisha can affect neighbouring states and communities.

Lifestyle for Environment should therefore emanate from India's pre-existing pockets of indigenous knowledge, and the rest of the country should embrace these learnings from the ground. India has the right policy ecosystem and governance support for reinventing its sustainability movement. All Indian states incentivise eco-friendly practices like organic farming, electric mobility, and renewable energy infrastructure. Adapting them to local contexts, linking sustainability with community practices and sharing best practices with the world is the way forward to build momentum for a Lifestyle for Environment.

Electricity generation rose 11.8% while mining output was up 7.8%, though the base effect of Covid-hit April 2021 partly magnified growth.","PTIPerformance in sync with GST collection, PMI numbers, auto sales and railway freight.Indiaâ€™s economy appears to have got off to a strong start in the fiscal year with industrial growth hitting an eight-month high of 7.1% in April, data released on Friday showed.

Manufacturing, which has a dominant 77.6% weight in the index of industrial production (IIP), grew 6.3% in the first month of FY23. Electricity generation rose 11.8% while mining output was up 7.8%, though the base effect of Covid-hit April 2021 partly magnified growth.

â€œThe impressive jump in IIP seems to corroborate RBIâ€™s prognosis in the last MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting that economic growth is on a relatively firm footing,â€ said CareEdge chief economist Rajani Sinha. The robust industrial performance is in sync with upbeat GST collection, purchasing managersâ€™ indices, automobile sales, and railway freight, among others.

â€œThe recovery has gained momentum despite the pandemic and the war,â€ RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said on Wednesday while announcing a half percentage point rise in the policy rate.



Industrial output grew 133% in April 2021 and 2.6% year-onyear in March 2022. Against the pre-Covid level of April 2019, IIP was 6.8% higher in April this year.

â€œThe growth rates over corresponding period of previous year are to be interpreted considering the unusual circumstances on account of Covid-19 pandemic since March 2020,â€ the ministry of statistics and programme implementation said.


STRONG HEADWINDS
Industrial activity and overall economic growth could moderate as the economy runs into high commodity prices, rising inflation, and monetary tightening The base effect will, however, push up growth in the early months of the year.

""We need to see if this momentum can be sustained going forward as it would be a prerequisite for growth in GDP to be sustained at over 7% this year,"" said Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis.

CRISIL chief economist DK Joshi said, ""Whatâ€™s worrying is that consumer goods growth remains weak, indicating sluggish private consumption."" A normal monsoon could boost rural demand. ""Given the sharp YoY expansion displayed by most high-frequency indicators in May 2022, we expect the IIP growth to rise further to 17-19% in that month, on the back of a falling base related to the second wave of Covid-19 in India in May 2021,"" said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar.


BROAD-BASED RECOVERY
Seventeen out of 22 manufacturing subsectors reported growth in output in April. ""It is a positive sign given that this month was associated with the war in Ukraine being at its peak as well as the sanctions being imposed,"" said Sabnavis.

Production of capital goods, a measure of investment activity, rose 14.7% in the month while consumer durables output, an indicator of discretionary demand, was up 8.5%. Consumer non-durables and construction goods grew at 0.3% and 3.8%, respectively. ""There is improvement across sectors, but what is specifically remarkable is the healthy jump in the manufacturing sector,"" said Sinha of CareEdge",Positive

2022-04-27,"Guarantees, LoCs to group companies will now have taut strings","The rules of the game on 'corporate guarantees' will change with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) insisting on a water-tight, time-bound mechanism for the issuance of guarantees and their invocation by lending banks.","Indian corporates will have to think twice before tossing 'guarantees' and 'letters of comfort' to help group companies raise money, notch up credit ratings, and bargain a lower interest rate on the back of such support from parents.

The rules of the game on 'corporate guarantees' will change with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) insisting on a water-tight, time-bound mechanism for the issuance of guarantees and their invocation by lending banks.

About a week ago, in a ""guidance note"" to credit rating agencies, the banking regulator has said that banks have to formally agree to a time frame within which they would invoke a guarantee following a loan default while the corporate guarantor has to commit to a deadline to pay up once the invocation by lenders takes place, a senior industry person told ET.

Rating agencies have been advised by the regulator to perform legal due diligence and ensure that the right structures and agreements are in place so that lenders, as well as borrowers, stick to a formally agreed timeline on invocation and loan repayment.

A corporate guarantee is a promise by the parent to assume the debt obligation of a group company if the latter fails to repay or service a loan.

""Banks rarely pull the trigger soon after a default. They try to negotiate and assess the situation. They may also delay the guarantee invocation to preserve business relationships with the group whose other group companies may be giving good business to the bank. Also, it could be an old client. Besides, recovering a loan through a guarantee invocation can be timing consuming,"" said a senior banker.

If a borrower refuses to repay post guarantee invocation, banks have to move the court or initiate proceedings at a Debts Recovery Tribunal.

""But a timeline spelt out in a guarantee document would certainly put extra pressure on a company to behave as it knows the bank is bound to act. I feel putting an end to open-ended corporate guarantees is a step in the right direction,"" said another person. ""Traditionally, banks never set a timeframe when a guarantee would be invoked. We have to figure out how this would work,"" he said.

Almost 90% of the 50,000 debt ratings in the country are on bank loans. Banks prefer rating on loans as risk weightage on such assets comes down, letting lenders preserve some capital.

The rating on a loan which has a corporate guarantee carries the tag 'CE' (or, 'credit enhancement'.) This improves the rating on the loan by at least one notch than it would have fetched without parent support. The RBI note relates to such loans.

RBI also said that an arm of a foreign company in India cannot be given 'CE' rating unless the overseas parent has a rating from one of the top three rating agencies in the world.

However, for non-loan debts, like non-convertible debentures or NCDs - a preferred borrowing route for several corporates - 'CE' on a rating does not reflect explicit support from the parent. Instead, it simply indicates that some extra cushion, like cash collateral, is set aside by the borrower to give a degree of comfort to financial creditors subscribing to the NCDs. 

In the case of securities which are 'guaranteed', rating agencies use the nomenclature 'SO' (or, structured obligation). But agencies add 'SO' to only ratings of securitised papers, like pass-through certificates, which though similar to bonds are riskier instruments and whose servicing of interest and principal repayment depends on the cash flow generated by an underlying pool of loans. Thus, what 'SO' is to a securitised paper, 'CE' is to a bank loan. 

""The guarantee structure for NCDs was streamlined by Sebi. Now RBI is doing it for bank loans which form the bulk of the ratings,"" said a source in the loan market.

Guarantees cannot be invoked once lenders initiate action under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against a corporate borrower and their petition is accepted by the National Company Law Tribunal - a quasi-judicial authority set up to deal with corporate disputes. There is a standstill on payouts to creditors by the company concerned once IBC proceedings begin.

2022-06-06,"Banks could be best sector, consumption looks strong: Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai","Given that India is at the beginning of a potentially large and long growth cycle, I am quite okay with valuations. They are not extended or too cheap, said Ridham Desai replying to a question","AgenciesMorgan Stanley India's Ridham Desai This is like a mid-bull market type of correction, said Morgan Stanley's head of India research Ridham Desai. In an interview with Sanam Mirchandani and Nishanth Vasudevan ahead of the firm's annual India conference, Desai said he is bullish on banks, consumer discretionary and technology. Edited excerpts:


How are you reading Indian market valuations after the recent fall?
Given that India is at the beginning of a potentially large and long growth cycle, I am quite okay with valuations. They are not extended or too cheap. At this point in the market cycle what matters is the growth cycle rather than valuations. We are at the mid-cycle stage; the early pickings are done when the valuation re-rates in anticipation of higher growth. The next stage is likely driven by growth rather than multiple expansion. This is like a mid-bull market type of correction. The global growth tailwind will not be as strong as it was in 2003-2007.


India's valuations have always been at a premium. Are they justified given the macro headwinds?
Emerging markets as a cohort are no longer the same as it was 20 years ago. Certain EMs are totally broken in macro terms. Comparing India with that cohort is becoming less and less relevant. I would want to look at this relative to India's own history. If you look at price to book, we are kind of on a par with history. Of course, the ROEs (return on equity) are below history. The market is anticipating a new ROE cycle. The ROE will probably get to around 20%, but I don't know whether we will get to 24%. Another thing is the GDP growth number. We averaged nearly 9% between 2003 and 2008. It is going to not go at that rate. The economy is very differently sized so it is unlikely to deliver the same type of real growth and that also impacts ROE.


Which investment themes are you betting on?
The banking space is our largest overweight position. In the next 12 to 18 months, banks could probably end up being the best performing sector. In banking, we have improving credit growth, falling credit costs and potentially rising NIMs (net interest margins) as rates go up. 

The other thing to watch out for is discretionary consumption. There's a revival in jobs and wages, and there is also pent-up demand coming out of the Covid lockdowns. Discretionary consumption looks very strong.

We also like tech. The US recession is not our base case but if it happens, then there will be some cutback on spending, and that will hurt Indian tech companies. A lot of them have surprised us on the upside with their transition from enterprise to digital over the last five-seven years. We are underweight everything else including healthcare, energy, materials and utilities.


Are the IT stock valuations cheap after the recent sell-off?
No, they are not. Their growth profile has shifted so they ought to be trading better than history especially if you take a 10-year period. If you take a 25-year history, then it is okay because they had gone into bubble territory at the end of the 90s. The correction reflects the concerns that both the US markets and Indian tech stocks have expressed about a potential US recession or a material slowdown in growth.


The 2003-2010 period belonged to infrastructure, 2010 to 2020 was consumption. Do you think this decade will belong to infrastructure again?
I would almost go to the extent of saying the stars are aligned for a major revival in India's manufacturing sector. The sector has lost share in GDP persistently over the last 20-25 years. A lot of things have changed in the last few years. We have competitive tax rates and corporations are looking to diversify away from China on an incremental basis and looking to come to India to set up production facilities. The government is trying direct cash incentives to companies to invest in India. Manufacturing would be the thing to watch out for in the next ten years.

With this, the government's total fertiliser subsidy is likely to touch a record Rs 2.15 lakh crore in the current 2022-23 fiscal.

""Despite rising fertiliser prices globally, we have protected our farmers from such price hikes. In addition to the fertiliser subsidy of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in the budget, an additional amount of Rs 1.10 lakh crore is being provided to further cushion our farmers,"" Sitharaman tweeted.

The fertiliser subsidy bill was estimated at Rs 1.05 lakh crore in the 2022-23 Budget. It stood at Rs 1,62,132 crore in 2021-22.

Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had recently said the total fertiliser subsidy bill could be between Rs 2-2.5 lakh crore in the current fiscal due to a sharp rise in global prices.

2022-05-19,Supreme Courts observation in Ocean Freight ruling could change landscape of GST framework: Experts,"The Supreme Court on Thursday, ruling has held that GST on ocean freight paid in case of import of goods is unconstitutional. Also, the Indian importers who had paid such tax will be eligible to refund.","The Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in the case of ocean freight that is set to give relief to several Indian companies and importers could also change the way the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework operates in the country, say legal experts.

The Supreme Court on Thursday, ruling has held that GST on ocean freight paid in case of import of goods is unconstitutional. Also, the Indian importers who had paid such tax will be eligible to refund.

Further, those importers who had not paid the tax on import of services will now not be required to pay tax because of this Supreme Court ruling.

The court also said that recommendations by the GST council are not binding on either the union or the state and it has persuasive value.


GST verdict: SC ruling may change 'one nation, one tax' conceptOn Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that GST on ocean freight paid in case of import of goods is unconstitutional. While the ruling in the case of ocean freight is set to give relief to several Indian companies, it could also change the way the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework operates in the country. Here's how.
â€œThis judgement may change the landscape of those provisions under GST which are subject to judicial review. As the court has gone ahead to categorically hold that the GST Council recommendations have only persuasive value, there will be pragmatic approach to the provisions which are subject to judicial review by way of challenge to the constitutionality of such provisions based on GST Council recommendationsâ€ said Abhishek A Rastogi, Partner at Khaitan & Co, who argued for the petitioners before Gujarat High Court, Supreme Court and several other courts.

Parliament and state legislatures possess equal powers to legislate on GST, SC ruled.

Experts say that it will be interesting to observe whether this would impact some of the ongoing controversies involving the state and the centre.

ET had first reported about the controversy in 2017 when the tax department had started issuing the notices.

The basic issue is that, in most cases, the ocean freight is paid by the seller or companies that are not based in India. So, for instance, if a company based in Europe is exporting goods to India, the company tends to enter into an agreement with shipping companies and pay ocean freight.

In such cases, the tax department is unable to recover GST from the European company. The tax department hopes to recover the IGST from importers or companies that are based in India through a ""reverse charge mechanism.""

The government had approached the Supreme Court against an earlier Gujarat High Court judgement that said that IGST (integrated GST) on ocean freight is unconstitutional.

In the last few months or so, the tax department has started issuing fresh tax demands and has issued notices to companies over GST on ocean freight.

Some of the companies had even approached various courts and failed writ petitions against the tax departmentâ€™s decision to issue tax notices.

The Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIFP) was developed after the abolition of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in May 2017.

After the abolition of FIPB, granting of government approval for overseas investment under the FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) policy and FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) regulations was entrusted to the concerned ministries/departments, the commerce ministry said in a statement.

The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), under the ministry, was made the nodal department.

It said, ""853 FDI proposals have been disposed of through FIFP since abolishment of FIPB.""

FDI proposals are now required to be filed only on the portal which is managed by the DPIIT.

The proposals filed on the portal are forwarded to the concerned administrative ministry and are also simultaneously marked to the ministry of external affairs and the Reserve Bank of India for comments and to the ministry of home affairs for necessary security clearance, wherever required as per the norms.

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for processing of FDI proposals, including documents to be filed, through the portal was framed and laid down by the DPIIT in June, 2017.

The DPIIT secretary reviews the pendency of all FDI proposals on a monthly basis.

2022-05-10,Why should retirement planning be a priority for every Indian?,"To sustain a hassle free retirement, retirement planning should be our foremost task.","ET SpotlightThe fact that Indians shy away from discussing retirement plans has a lot to do with our lack of financial literacy. Most of us have spent many precious minutes fantasizing about the day when we can retire and won't have to go to work. We dream about a happy retirement, imagining ourselves taking a break from all responsibilities. However, only a few of us will be able to live this ideal retirement life when the time eventually comes to do so.

After a certain age, we're all faced with the responsibility of looking after our aging parents but we fail to remember that the same fate awaits our children too when we meet our retirement age, unless we ensure adequate retirement planning ahead of time. For example, a stable retirement fund ensures that we're never financially vulnerable and can afford any care we require. 

To be clear, experts believe there are three important reasons why retirement planning should be a priority.


You can't work forever. Many of us want to work post-retirement too. But will the meagre income be sustainable? Hence, retirement planning is essential to be financially independent after you stop working.
The future is uncertain, and you might have to make an unplanned large investment. But will it be possible to execute this if you can't work? Good savings and the right investment can help you through unprecedented times and challenges.
Health problems are unavoidable as time passes by. Medical expenses are bound to make a dent in your savings and leave you stranded financially post-recovery.
India, like several other developed countries, lacks a social security system to care for the aged. There is neither free medical care nor a monthly government pay-out on which pensioners can rely. Even government employees who formerly had the security of a guaranteed pension must now build a corpus because the government has eliminated this benefit for most of its employees.

So why are we not prioritizing retirement plans? How long can we postpone an ever-looming necessity? Beyond the age of 50, one barely has the time and money to plan a joyful retirement. If this rings a bell for you, here are some of the best tips from industry experts to plan your retirement.


Create alternate sources of income.
Keep increasing the contribution to your retirement savings every year.
Do not rely solely on security schemes.
 Keep risk factors in mind before investing a considerable sum of money.
Consider inflation. Rs. 10 lakhs today will not have the same monetary value 20 years later.
Stay away from excessive expenditure.

Conclusion
In an environment of rising inflation and market volatility, it's essential to have a retirement fund large enough to last you your lifetime. Otherwise, you risk being compelled to work during your retirement, a situation that no one wants to be in.

Sure, you can take a chance and trust that your children will take care of you, but that is a significant leap of faith to make. And even if they are prepared to do so, would you want to burden your offspring with the obligation of providing for your financial well-being in your old age?

Maloo Investwise cuts out the confusion over what modes of investment to use for the highest returns on your retirement fund and provides you with a comprehensive financial plan that stands true to the test of time. So with whatever little you have, start today!

2022-06-07,The reason why India can't ignore Gulf outrage,"Over the years, India's business connections with these countries have only become stronger. For its oil needs, India relies heavily on this region.","Prophet comment row: 5 reasons India can't ignore Gulf outrage over Nupur Sharma's statementThe relations that bind the Gulf and India are based not only on trade and commerce but history and culture. In the Gulf, millions of Indians live and work and it forms the biggest chunk of remittances to India.

Over the years, India's business connections with these countries have only become stronger. For its oil needs, India relies heavily on this region.

Indians make up more than a third of the UAE's population. In the Gulf, there are 89 lakh Indian citizens.

Some of the major retail stores and restaurants in the Gulf countries are owned by Indians. The calls to boycott Indian products could hit businesses owned by Indians.

The United Arab Emirates is India's third-largest trading partner.

The Gulf states also rely on India. After the United States, the UAE is India's second-largest export destination and third-largest trading partner. 

India and the UAE's bilateral trade was valued at $72.9 billion in 2021-22, with India's exports accounting for $28.4 billion.

Under the newly concluded Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, total trade is expected to reach $100 billion by 2026.

The Gulf region is especially reliant on food and cereal imports; over 85% of their food and 93% of their cereals are imported.

Rice, buffalo meat, spices, marine products, fruits, vegetables, and sugar are all key exports from India.

The aviation industry of Gulf countries* rely heavily on AAE Indian flyers. The advent of global transit hubs in the Gulf, serviced by local airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways, has reduced the share of the lucrative international travel market held by US and India-based airlines.

Around half of remittances to India come from just five Gulf countries

In 2018, just five Gulf countries accounted for more than half of all remittances.

Kerala has the highest percentage of remittances, while Delhi's share has risen in recent years. UP and Bihar have experienced substantial growth.

The Gulf supplies over 60% of India's crude.

India imports a significant amount of crude oil from Gulf countries, not just to meet its energy needs but also for strategic and security reasons.Hardeep Puri, India's petroleum minister, told Parliament in March that the country consumes 5 million barrels of oil per day, with 60 percent of that coming from the Gulf.

In a May 6 order, the apex court dismissed all the appeals. ""In terms of the request made before the court, the appeals are dismissed as withdrawn,"" the court ruled.","RelatedTaxpayers can now claim refund of IGST on ocean freight: Experts on SC judgementCBDT notified amendment in Faceless penalty scheme, allowing mandatory personal hearingJharkhand High Court to hear maintainability of PIL seeking probe against CM Hemant Soren on June 1Mumbai: The decade-old retrospective tax controversy that put India on the global map is finally over with the tax department withdrawing its petition from the Supreme Court challenging a 2015 high court ruling favouring Sanofi.

While Sanofi, like many other multinationals, settled this with the taxman under India's plan to rescind the indirect transfer of assets amendment or retrospective tax amendment in December, the appeal in Supreme Court was yet to be withdrawn. In a May 6 order, the apex court dismissed all the appeals. ""In terms of the request made before the court, the appeals are dismissed as withdrawn,"" the court ruled.

""The controversy around the indirect transfer of shares is now put to bed as the government withdrew its appeal in the Supreme Court. While the settlement scheme was accepted in December, the pending appeals in the SC meant that the matter was technically ongoing,"" said Rohan Shah, counsel.

In 2009, French drug maker Sanofi Aventis bought a stake in Hyderabad based vaccine manufacturer Shanta Biotech. The transaction was carried out in France as the buyer-Sanofi-as well as the sellers-- Institut Merieux (IM) and Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault (GIMD)-were French companies.

The tax department had demanded â‚¹2,000 crore in the case including tax and penalties. Andhra Pradesh High Court had quashed the tax demand, after which the revenue department had approached the Supreme Court.

According to Ashish K Singh, managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal, this shows the revenue department's commitment of ending litigation for matters on which a policy decision has been taken by the government. 

""It is pertinent to note that more than 50% of cases pending before the Supreme Court and High Court are against the government and such proactive steps go a long way in setting a precedent in other similar cases before various courts across the country,"" said Singh.

Apart from Vodafone and Cairn Energy, companies including Sanofi, Mitsui, WNS, Tata group and Genpact that were litigating or had initiated arbitration proceedings against the tax department settled the tax issue with the government.

The government has promised it will refund taxes already collected and withdraw all litigation and arbitration if companies withdraw litigation, arbitration and let go of damages, interest or any other cost.

In most cases the mergers, acquisitions or restructuring conducted by these companies faced taxes in India.

The government's rationale was that most of the valuation (more than 50%) of the assets or companies that were sold came from India or Indian customers.

2022-06-13,Mutual funds witness record surges in two years as pandemic instils financial discipline,Covid-19 lockdowns and low-interest rates have encouraged investors to invest more in mutual funds.,"ET SpotlightEquity markets have seen a sharp recovery from Covid-19 lows, and continuous investor inflows have pushed the industry assets under management (AUM)* well past the Rs. 38 lakh crore mark for the financial year-ended 31 March 2022.

In March, the AUM* for the equity segment, at Rs. 13.6 lakh crores, surpassed that of the debt segment at Rs. 12.9 lakh crore for the first time. By comparison, just two years ago, in March 2020, equity AUM* stood at just Rs. 7 lakh crore, while debt AUM was at Rs. 10.3 lakh crore. Since then, thereâ€™s been a continuous month-over-month increase in AUM*. Even when you consider the hybrid schemes or multi-asset schemes, the allocation for equity is much higher.

Traditionally, Indian investors have always preferred investing in real estate, gold, and bank fixed deposits (FDs), but poor inflation-adjusted returns for these asset classes have led to a shift in investor preferences. Direct equity is still considered difficult by new investors, and most prefer to enter the markets via the mutual fund route. Between March 2020 and October 2021, benchmark equity indices had more than doubled, attracting many new investors to stock markets.

The fact that domestic inflows have been steadily increasing even during such tumultuous times over the past two years is a sign of increased investor participation and growing share of household savings into mutual funds. We also find newer investors in recent graduates who have just started working, as well as among the many who have shifted to the work-from-home (WFH) model. They are tech-savvy and adapt easily to online investing. Covid-19 lockdowns and low-interest rates have encouraged investors to start investing in mutual funds. Job uncertainties have also taught us the importance of regular savings, and this discipline reflects in the monthly systematic investment plan (SIPs) inflows.

While the flows in equity funds have seen robust growth, inflows into debt funds have been poor due to below-par returns, compared to bank FDs. In 2020 and 2021, large-cap funds generated average returns of 15-25 percent*** while most of the shorter-end debt fund categories have given average returns of 3-5 percent*** in the same time frame.

Increased participation by retail investors has also led to greater awareness about the various funds offered by asset management companies (AMC). While seasoned investors may prefer to invest directly with the AMCs, new investors prefer to do it via mutual fund distributors (MFD). While direct plans have lesser expenses, regular plans offered by MFDs help newer clients build up portfolios, plan SIPs, and carry out non-financial transactions like KYC updates, address changes, etc with ease.

Even senior citizens who earlier relied on a fixed income like deposits and debt funds, are now keen to explore mutual funds which offer better risk-adjusted returns.

Investors are also willing to stay invested for longer, even through periods of volatility. Earlier, retail investors would panic at the slightest dip. But now we see more investors ready to hold on through corrections of 10-15 percent**, with some even using it as an opportunity for lumpsum investments.

Indeed, the pandemic has slowly and steadily instilled a sense of financial discipline in the retail investor, thereby improving their preparedness for a rainy day.

2022-06-06,Put your money where your dreams are,Start your investments with some goals in your life.,"ET SpotlightWhat if, in a football match, there are 22 players running after a ball but there are no goalposts? Doesnâ€™t make sense, does it? It doesnâ€™t.

But when it comes to investments, most of us make this mistake. Most people do random savings and invest without financial goals. As the saying goes, â€œAn investment without a goal is like a traveller without a destination.â€

Why goal-based investing?
Money can be a tool to accomplish greater goals in your life, such as giving your child the best education, pursuing your hobbies, travelling to the destinations youâ€™ve always wanted, buying your dream home, saving for your golden yearsâ€¦ the list goes on.

Youâ€™re closer to achieving your goals when your money goes into goal-based investments rather than random savings. Goal-based investing ensures that you save for each goal in advance, which makes it more likely for you to achieve them. Also, it helps you match your time horizon to your asset allocation.


Before investing your money, you should know the 4Ks - Kya? Kab? Kitna? & Kaise?

ET Spotlight
Kya - what is the investment for?


Kab - when would you require this money? If you know what your goal is and the time you have in hand, itâ€™s wiser to invest in equities that work best in the long-term, rather than investing in short-term assets and compromising the return.


Kitna - how much money would you require? You need to adjust the current cost with the inflation to arrive at the future cost.


Kaise - how much do you need to invest? Investments can be done via SIPs or lump sums. Here, you also need to define your asset allocation, which will depend on your risk appetite. You can get your risk profile test done to arrive at the asset allocation.


Below are some of the behavioural and financial reasons why goal-based investment is a better way of investing:

1) Avoid under-saving: Goal-based investments make you think and enumerate your goals in advance. This prevents you from miscalculating how much money youâ€™ll need to invest for your financial goals. Instead of random savings, you will save the appropriate amount.

2) Plan ahead, save less, achieve more: Goal-based investing means lesser liabilities. Hereâ€™s how: when you start saving for a goal well ahead of time, you need to save less. Why? Because you will benefit from the power of compounding. The earlier you start saving, the more time there is for the investments to grow.

For example, you require a corpus of Rs. 100 lakhs for your childrenâ€™s higher education. You need to save just Rs. 17,000/month for 18 years if you start at the time he/she is born. But if you start 5 years later, you need to invest Rs. 31,000/month - 55% more every month.

Returns are assumed at 10% per annum. (Investment amounts are for illustrative purposes only and does not assure any guaranteed returns.)


3) Save for a tangible outcome: Think about the outcome of your investment. When you attach a real outcome to the purpose of your saving, youâ€™re more likely to work towards that goal. It also discourages you from withdrawing or redeeming the funds in between due to short-term market fluctuation and it keeps you on track.


4) Guilt-free spending: While some might find it surprising, there are people who feel guilty and are uncomfortable with spending large amounts of money. But when you spend money from an investment specifically earmarked for that purpose, you will spend it without guilt. 


5) Achieve optimal returns: Goal-based investing matches your time horizon with your asset allocation, and you can allocate investments according to the time frame of the goal. A bike is best for going around the city, but to go to another country, you need to get on a flight. Similarly, different assets work differently in different time horizons. Goal-based investing ensures that you invest in the most suitable asset depending on your goals to ensure optimum returns. For example, if your goal is 12 years away, equities would be the best way to go. But if your goal is just a couple of years away, equities might not give you the desired results.

If you arenâ€™t investing based on your goals, youâ€™re just running in a field with a ball, not knowing where to shoot. Start goal-based investing now and win the game!

Happy Goal-Based Investing!

Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining.""Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the baseline credit assessments of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, reflecting improvements in credit fundamentals, particularly asset quality. The global rating agency has upgraded the baseline credit assessments (BCAs) to baa3 from ba1. 

 The upgrade of the BCAs does not result in any change in the deposit ratings because these are already at the same level as the India sovereign rating (Baa3 stable), Moody's said in a statement on Friday. 

 ""The upgrade of the two banks' BCAs is driven by improvements in asset quality, capital, and profitability. Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining. 

 ""Credit costs have also reduced at the same time as provision coverage has increased. Lower credit costs have resulted in higher profitability,"" it said. 

 ICICI Bank and Axis Bank's return on assets for the year ending March 2022 was 1.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, compared to an average of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent over the four years ending March 2020, it said. 

 ICICI Bank's profitability has also benefited from rising net interest margins as the share of the low margin international business has come down in the last four years, it added. 

 Both lenders have raised equity capital, resulting in significantly higher capital ratios, it said, adding the core equity tier 1 ratios of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at end March 2022 were 17.6 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, compared to 13.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent at end March 2019. 

 However, it said, Axis Bank's proposed acquisition of Citigroup Inc's India consumer assets will result in an approximately 230 bps decline in capital at the bank. 

 As Axis Bank has good access to capital markets, the ratings agency expects the bank to raise capital to maintain its current capital ratios. 

 Axis Bank is targeting to close the acquisition by March 2023.",Positive
2022-05-16,Some states have a bigger inflation battle in their hands,"Noted economist DK Joshi attributed such high inflation in these states to two factors â€” a) higher penetration of rural economy, and b) the variance in fuel duties, which are likely higher in the states in question.","iStockIn India, headline inflation is now at the highest level since May 2014 when it had hit 8.33%.Some states are having to bear the brunt of inflation more than others as relentless price rise of everyday-use items continues to run households ragged across the country.

While last week's data put CPI numbers at a near 8-year high of 7.8 per cent, four states â€” West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Telangana â€” registered inflation of 9 per cent.

In seven other states in the country, inflation for the period under consideration breached 8 per cent, data showed.

These states are probably seeing more price pressures as their supplies have gotten disrupted more because of the Ukraine war, economists have noted.

A few states, though, are not seeing much prices pressures. At the other end of the spectrum, two states â€” Kerala and Tamil Nadu â€” saw April inflation at just over 5%.

Noted economist DK Joshi attributed such high inflation in these states to two factors â€” a) higher penetration of rural economy, and b) the variance in fuel duties, which are likely higher in the states in question.

It is worth noting here that rural inflation, at 8.4 per cent, rose more than urban inflation (7.1 per cent).

This calls for a detailed analysis of the divergence of inflation rates across the country, ToI said quoting Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil.

TNNGraphic: TNNIn India, headline inflation is now at the highest level since May 2014 when it had hit 8.33%.

Just ahead of the April numbers, RBI's Monetary Policy Committee had raised the benchmark interest rate by 40 bps at an unscheduled meeting with the aim to get a handle on rising inflation. This was India's first rate raise since August 2018.

2022-05-14,"Govt weighs wheat export cap, more rice in food scheme",The food ministry is trying to ensure there is enough supply in the domestic market at reasonable prices without disturbing exports,"A limit on wheat exports and the use of more rice in its place in the national food programme are among measures the government is considering to rein in prices of wheat and flour.

Local prices of wheat and atta have risen sharply as India has stepped up exports of the cereal following a nearly 40% rally in global rates in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

This year's wheat production is pegged at 95 million tonnes (mt) by traders, against government estimates of 105 mt, likely tightening local supplies and causing prices to rise. Wheat is priced at â‚¹2,550 per quintal (100 kg) at Kandla port, having risen sharply recently as exporters are trying to speed up shipments, anticipating curbs by the government. 

Minimum support price (MSP) for wheat procurement is â‚¹2,015 per quintal. Retail inflation in wheat and atta spiked to 9.59% in April, from 7.77% in March. The government's wheat procurement has fallen nearly 55% as open market prices are higher than MSP. 


Measures Ahead 
 Indian traders have contracted for export of 4.5 mt of wheat till June, while actual exports in April were 1.4 mt.

The Roller Flour Millers Federation of India discussed wheat availability with food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey on Thursday.




""The millers expressed their concern about the availability of wheat in the country post the harvest season in light of reduced crop size and reduced ability of the government to intervene and cool prices by offering OMMS (open market sale scheme) wheat, due to lower procurement,"" said a miller who was present at the meeting.

The food ministry is trying to ensure there is enough supply in the domestic market at reasonable prices without disturbing exports, said people with knowledge of the matter.

However, if prices rise further, the government may impose quantitative limits on exports. The other option is to substitute 5-7 mt of wheat with rice, for distribution under National Food Security Act schemes. ""This wheat can then be used for OMSS sales to control inflation,"" said a person aware of the matter.

Its extension by a day, till Thursday, brought some hopes that members could still find a way to stitch together a deal. After being postponed twice because of Covid, this ministerial was held after a long gap of about five years.","ReutersThe negotiators at the World Trade Organization (WTO) had a long and anxious night on Wednesday as they participated in multiple â€œgreen roomâ€ deliberations and off-record sessions to finalise a deal before receiving a message marked in red capital letters that the heads of delegation (HoD) meeting scheduled for 10.30 PM got cancelled. 

Instead WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called for a meeting of a smaller group comprising 10 countries including India, ET has learnt. 

That closed-door session did not yield any tangible results, following which a series of informal deliberation continued into the wee hours of Thursday morning.

As commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and seven other officers including secretary BVR Subrahmanyam and ambassador Brajendra Navnit did not have time to get out of the WTO building, embassy officials delivered packed fried rice and pasta at the venue itself, an officer added. 

Barring Afghanistan and Myanmar, all other 162 member nations participated in the ministerial that kicked off in Geneva on Sunday. 

Its extension by a day, till Thursday, brought some hopes that members could still find a way to stitch together a deal. 

After being postponed twice because of the Covid pandemic, this ministerial at the WTO headquarters was held after a long gap of about five years. 

On the intervening night of June 15 and 16, the members did attempt to bridge the gap in the agreements, which were still replete with brackets and blanks on a range of issues such as WTOâ€™s response to the pandemic and a waiver of the intellectual property rights for vaccines, fisheries subsidies, food security and agriculture. Most nations decided that they would favour inking of an outcome document and also a watered down deal on fisheries subsidies. 

During the night, no consensus could be found on issues related to agriculture. 

In fact, the cancellation of the heads of delegation meeting scheduled for Wednesday night was the first sign of things getting out of hand. 

It was cancelled at the last moment as the delegates received a message, marked as urgent. 

The word â€œcancelledâ€ was written in red letters, the sources said. The message, however, added one sentence â€” â€œFurther information will be communicated in due courseâ€, the same source said. 

Informal meetings resumed at 9.15 on Thursday morning. 

All critical deliberation took place at the WTO headquarters located by the side of Lake Geneva.

These Indian banks will likely open accounts at their Russian counterparts and vice versa, as decided last week in meetings held in New Delhi to ensure smooth trade flows without violating the economic sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to come out with an operational circular, paving the way for this. Such accounts, held by one bank in another in a foreign country are known as Loro, Vostro and Nostro.

The RBI did not reply to ET's email seeking comment. The banks could not be contacted immediately.

""While Indian authorities have shown unprecedented seriousness to expand bilateral trades, the Russian delegation ensured every possible measure to promote trade relations,"" said an executive who participated in the meetings.



In the last week's meetings, officials from the Indian government, the RBI and the Bank of Russia, as well as bankers from both sides were present, as ET reported on June 15. State Bank of India and IndusInd Bank too participated at the meeting.

From the Russian side, nearly a dozen banks that are not under sanctions held discussions with the Indian regulators, banks and government officials. These banks included Petersburg Social Commercial Bank, Zenit Bank, Tatsotsbank, CentroCredit Bank, Bank Soyuz, MTC Bank and Gazprombank, as per a list ET has seen.

If these banks from both sides start engaging bilaterally, banking transactions can take place in any currency: the dollar, euro, rupee or the rouble.

After the start of the Ukraine war, the Western world imposed economic sanctions on nine large banks, which contribute the rest four-fifths of the banking industry. The sanctions have firewalled Moscow access to the globally used SWIFT banking platform, which in turn upset the payment network for those lenders.

Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia to become India's second biggest supplier of oil behind Iraq, as refiners sought Russian crude available at a deep discount amid the ongoing war with Ukraine.

The discount factor works well with North Block, which is battling soaring import bills that may push India's current account deficit to over 3% of GDP in FY23, according to projections by economists.

Russia's share in India's oil purchases reportedly rose to 18% at about 8,19,000 barrels a day in May, according to a report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

The meetings of the banks were aimed at shortlisting bilateral payment options to ensure smooth trade flows, without violating global sanctions.

Large Russian lenders including Sberbank, VTB Bank and VEB, which are under sanctions, also attended the meetings.

India had a trade deficit of $6.61 billion with Russia in the year ended March 2022, with total bilateral trade at $13.1 billion. In the first three months of the current fiscal year FY23, India's trades - both imports and exports - are said to have gone up sizably.",Positive

Fundamentals for the sector will improve especially due to India's continuing economic recovery which Moodys expects will grow at 8.4% in the fiscal ended March 2023 down from 9.3% in the year ended March 2022.
""Increasing corporate earnings and easing funding constraints for non-bank finance companies, which are significant borrowers from banks, will support loan growth. We expect growth in bank loans to accelerate to 12%-13% in fiscal 2023 from 5% in fiscal 2022,"" Moodys said.

Bad loan ratios will decline because of recoveries or write-offs of legacy problem loans while formation of new stressee loans will be stablise as the economy recovers. ""Loan growth will help push NPL ratios down by expanding the overall pool of loans, even though new defaults may arise from loans that have been restructured because of economic disruptions from the pandemic. The quality of corporate loans will be stable, supported by growth in earnings and a cleanup of legacy problem loans to corporates, while risks will linger in loans to retail borrowers and small and medium-sized enterprises because relief measures for them have somewhat masked stress among them,"" Moody's said.

Growth in pre-provision earnings and decline in loan-loss provisions will result in improvements in profitability which will also be suppored by gradual increases in domestic interest rates as banks will be able to pass on higher rates to borrowers.

The only risk flagged by the rating agency is the global economic fallout from the Russia-Ukraine military conflict which will could fuel inflation because of rising oil prices and an impact on the value of emerging market currencies like the rupee.

unding and liquidity to be stable for both public and private sector banks. 
""Deposit growth will slow because corporates and individuals will use excess cash for consumption and new business opportunities. Still, increases in low-cost current and savings account deposits will help banks keep funding costs stable even as interest rates rise,"" Moody's said.

Improving profitability will also offset increases in capital consumption due to an acceleration in loan growth, helping banks across the system maintain capital at current levels.

Rated private sector banks had an asset-weighted average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 15.8% at the end of calender 2021, which positions them well to capture opportunities to grow loans. PSBs' capitalization remains weaker than that of their private-sector peers, but their asset-weighted average CET1 rose to 10.5% at the end of calendar 2021 from 10.0% as of 31 March 2021, Moodys said.

2022-05-16,Inflation increase due to war impact; RBI may hike rates by 75 bps by August: SBI Economists,"The economists said they did a study of the Russian invasion's impact on inflation, which revealed that 59 per cent of the jump in prices is due to geopolitical events.","AgenciesAlmost 59 percent of inflation since February is due to war related factors, according to a study by SBI economists. But there are concerns amidst this backdrop about whether rate hikes by the central bank will be useful in taming inflation forcing the central bank to go for more aggressive rate hikes during the year.

Using February as the base case when the Ukraine and Russia conflict began, the SBI economists study reveals that Food and Beverages (assuming that vegetable price increase was mostly because of seasonal factors, that are largely domestic) and Fuel and Light & Transport contributed 52% of the increase in overall inflation since February because of the war. "" If we also add the impact of input costs particularly on the FMCG sector, thus adding the contribution of personal care and effects, the total impact at all India level comes to 59%, purely because of war"" said S K Ghosh, group chief economic advisor at State Bank of India.




Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has crossed way beyond the mandated upper band of 2-6 per cent. Headline CPI inflation touched 6.95 per cent in March forcing the monetary policy to review rates on May 4, and raise benchmark policy repo rates by 40 bps ( one bps is 0.01 percent) to 4.4 percent ahead of its scheduled meeting in June.Subsequently the April CPI inflation touched an eight year high at 7.79 percent. ""However, the important challenge facing the central bank remains whether inflation will tread down meaningfully because of such rate hikes if war related disruptions do not subside quickly"" said Ghosh.

Even in these circumstances where addressing supply side issues play a bigger role in addressing inflation, even demand and inflation expectations can be managed by central banks, say some economists. "" Rate hike will slow the build-up of excess demand. Cannot affect war factors"" said Madan Sabnavis chief economist, Bank of Baroda. ""But if rates rise and credit slows demand for say cement and steel is curbed which lowers inflation. Companies won't invest unless demand is there. Hence this part of inflation curbed. This holds everywhere in the world. As the economy slows demand slows and prices curbed"".

The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not showing any signs of abating that could put further pressure on CPI inflation. ""The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not showing any signs of cooling down. In fact, on the margin, the geopolitical environment seems to have deteriorated amidst unrelenting posturing by the two sides. This has raised the pressure on commodity prices further"" said a report by ratings firm Acuite Ratings and Research.

Economists expect the RBI to restore repo rates to the pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent by August it-self. If inflation continues to remain high, there could be over 100 bps rate hikes this fiscal in addition to a hike in cash reserve ratio or CRR.

""A higher interest rate will be also positive for the financial system as risks will get repriced"" Ghosh said.

The earlier thinking was that Centre should retain at least 26% stake during privatisation and that this could be brought down gradually.","AgenciesRepresentative imageThe government will likely introduce a bill in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament to make amendments to facilitate the privatisation of state-run banks.

One of the amendments under consideration is allowing the central government a complete exit from banks being privatised, said an official aware of deliberations. The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, requires the central government to hold at least 51% of public sector banks. The earlier thinking was that Centre should retain at least 26% stake during privatisation and that this could be brought down gradually.

""The bill will provide an enabling mechanism. We might bring it in this session and then iron out the other issues,"" said another official, adding that the changes are based on discussions with potential investors during recent roadshows for the IDBI Bank stake sale.

The finance ministry is also in discussions with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the banking sector regulator, on ownership and controlling stakes issues relating to privatisation. Promoters can currently hold a maximum 26% stake in private banks.


Was to be Introduced in Winter Session 
 The dates of the monsoon session of Parliament have not been announced yet.

The government had listed the Banking Laws Amendment Bill, 2021, in the winter session of Parliament that concluded on December 22, 2021, but it wasn't introduced. The bill had proposed ""amendments in Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts, 1970 and 1980 and incidental amendments to Banking Regulation Act, 1949"".




The first official cited above said, ""We have received inputs from potential investors, merchant bankers, and even industry. We will incorporate changes if required to make the stake sale process faster and with less regulatory hurdles.""

In the budget for FY22 presented on February 1, 2021, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the government will privatise two public sector banks and one general insurer.

She had said the necessary legislative amendments would be introduced in the ensuing budget session.

In April 2021, the Niti Aayog had given its recommendations on the banks that should be privatised to the disinvestment department. Central Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank have reportedly been shortlisted, but the names have not been made public. There hasn't been much progress since then, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

IDBI Bank's privatisation process is already underway. The bank is incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, and legal amendments are not needed for its privatisation.

2022-04-13,Inflation wave reaches Asia with signs worst is yet to come,"Inflation across the region -- China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and South Korea -- recently rose more than forecast, while New Zealand on Wednesday hiked rates by the most in 22 years over price worries. And accelerating manufacturing costs suggest the worst is yet to come.","The world is now facing a synchronized inflation outbreak as food and energy prices surge in Asia, a shift from just a few months ago when the region appeared to avoid the price fever gripping the U.S. and parts of Europe. 

Inflation readings across the region -- China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and South Korea -- recently rose more than forecast, while New Zealand on Wednesday hiked rates by the most in 22 years over price worries. And accelerating manufacturing costs suggest the worst is yet to come.

Markets are starting to price in rising inflation expectations and more aggressive central bank action across much of Asia. Thatâ€™s beginning to mirror trends seen in the U.S., where data Tuesday showed consumer prices last month rose by the most since late 1981, piling fresh pressure on the Federal Reserve to respond.

Regional government bond yields have risen through this year, led by South Korea, with the emerging Asia total return index down 2.6%, its worst performance since 2013. That signals an expectation that some central banks will raise interest rates to slow inflation and prop up their currencies as capital leaves the region.


Bloomberg

The turning point was Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered an upheaval in commodities markets. That pushed energy and fuel prices higher and threatened grain supplies to the worldâ€™s top consuming region. Rising fertilizer and transport costs are also filtering through to compound record global food prices. 

Elevated commodities prices are seen fanning inflation in developing Asia by 1 full percentage point to 3.7% this year, the Asian Development Bank said earlier this month. While thatâ€™s relatively tame compared to rates in the U.S., itâ€™s forcing policymakers to shift focus and spooking some investors.

A net $22.3 billion in investments last month flowed out of emerging Asia, excluding China, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group -- marking the biggest sell-off since March 2020.

India, the worldâ€™s second-most populous nation, is feeling the food and energy pinch. At his vegetable stall in a Mumbai suburb, Dnyaneshwar Uttam Santeâ€™s problems could be seen in the plastic bag of mixed vegetables he had just packed for a customer: He was charging 450 rupees, or almost $6, which is about 80% more than a few weeks ago. 

â€œIâ€™m helpless,â€ Sante said, just as a customer chimed in about the â€œunbelievableâ€ cost of a cooking gas cylinder, which had risen almost 30% to 960 rupees. 

The reaction by the Reserve Bank of India is emblematic of Asiaâ€™s growing pressures. Governor Shaktikanta Das last week cited a â€œtectonic shiftâ€ in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook since the end of February -- basically, Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine -- which â€œupended the earlier narrativeâ€ of calmer price pressures this year. 

â€œIn the sequence of our priorities, we have now put inflation over growth,â€ Das said. 

In China, producer prices gained 8.3% from a year earlier, down from 8.8% in February but still above the median estimate of an 8.1%. Consumer prices excluding fresh food in Japan, the Bank of Japanâ€™s benchmark, rose 0.6% in February from a year earlier, the fastest pace in two years, driven up by energy costs.

Central banks in South Korea and Singapore also meet this week, with economists split on prospects for another rate increase in Seoul while those in the city-state of Singapore are expected to tighten settings to combat imported inflation, especially energy. 

Food poses the biggest inflation risk to Asian central banks despite the region being a net exporter, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. Rolling lockdowns in China to suppress Covid-19 are another potential source of inflation for logistics.

Whatâ€™s more, further consumer price hikes are likely as manufacturersâ€™ input costs continue to climb. 

While the correlation between factory prices and consumer costs is influenced by a range of factors, as some companies absorb the charges or as exchange rates soften the blow, analysts at ANZ and Nomura Holdings Inc. see more inflation coming.

â€œThe gap between PPI and CPI is currently exceptionally large,â€ said Krystal Tan, an economist at ANZ, referring to prices paid by producers and consumers. â€œThis suggests to me that there are significant price pressures in the pipeline that will flow into CPI eventually as producers start to pass through more of the higher input costs.â€


â€œAsia supply chain stress is set to worsen in the months ahead, adding to concern about global inflation. The war in Ukraine is driving up fuel prices and Shanghaiâ€™s Covid-19 lockdown is gumming up the worldâ€™s biggest port. The data doesnâ€™t all point in one direction, but elevated commodity costs and longer delivery times signal persistent snarls.â€-- Chang Shu, Chief Asia Economist
One producer feeling the squeeze is Kenneth Wong, who runs one of the worldâ€™s leading manufacturers of bras, with factories in China, Cambodia and Thailand. He has seen input prices jump for the about 20 components needed for the clothing staple such as fabric, foam pads, metal wire and plastic adjusters.

And prices are still rising, according to Wong, who heads up Top Form Bras, a Hong Kong-based company founded by his father. 

While in normal circumstances Wong would quote clients a price for a product that would hold for its life cycle -- as long as three years, for example -- heâ€™s now updating prices on a rolling basis.

â€œPreviously when I was buying things like elastic or thread or buckles, we didnâ€™t even need to think about it,â€ Wong said. â€œBut now, you really need to manage it.â€

The head of the conglomerate which recently launched its new super app aggregating offerings of group companies also welcomed the government's participative approach in writing the new law. 

 ""I think the Digital India Act is necessary because so much has changed over the last couple of decades since the original IT Act was put in place,"" Chandrasekaran said, addressing the annual general meeting of the group's cash cow TCS virtually. 

 ""I am glad that the government is engaged and developing a participative approach to develop the Digital Act which is an important thing, especially there are new issues like privacy and other aspects that will come into this (new) Act,"" he added. 

 Chandrasekaran, who was elevated as the group chairman after heading TCS, said the IT major will now be getting into working in the hybrid mode, but made it clear that he prefers employees working from offices. 

 TCS has nearly 6 lakh staffers. 

 ""While it is my personal preference to encourage employees to come back to work and I would like to see a significant number of employees back in the office, the company is already working with the employees. So, while there will be hybrid, we expect most employees to come back and return to the offices,"" he said. 

 TCS will not be impacted by inflationary impulses in the global markets, from where it derives maximum revenues, Chandrasekaran said, adding that there will not be any curb on technology spends as digital transformation is a reality. 

 The Tata Group chairman further said inflation in the country will be range-bound and lower than the developed world. 

 Chandrasekaran, who has also served the board of RBI in the past, said, ""...the Indian market is extremely well placed for growth and the inflation in India will be lower than the western countries and also with the regulators in India continuing to monitor this space, I am hoping that this (inflation) will be very range-bound."" 

 TCS continues its goal of having the operating profit margin between 26-28 per cent, but there are uncertainties due to volatilities, he said. 

 Asked about the Rs 1,200-crore provision made for Epic Systems' trade secrets lawsuit, Chandrasekaran said he feels the money which has been set aside is ""adequate"". 

 He said the company gets only 5 per cent of its revenues from the domestic market, and he does not see it hitting the double-digit mark for many years to come. 

 Meanwhile, Chandrasekaran also said the Tata Group is very keen to invest more in northeast India, create more jobs and also increase its spends in the social sector.

The surge is mainly driven mainly by vegetable inflation which grew dramatically to 56.36% in May from 23.24% in April.

The downward trend in the manufacturing segment is due to a decrease in the inflation rates of edible oil (from 15.05% to 11.41%) and basic metals (from 24.81% to 18.88%). 

For the fuel and power segment, the WPI number jumped to 40.62% in May, from 38.66% in April, owing to an increase in the price of mineral oils. The prices of coal and electricity remained unchanged. 

The number comes a day after the government published the CPI inflation which came down to 7.04% on the back of dropped fuel prices following duty cuts. However, the increased WPI number might put pressure on retail inflation. 

The number comes a few days after the RBI revised India's inflation projection to 6.7% from the earlier estimate of 5.7% in the Monetary Policy Committeeâ€™s (MPC) June meeting based on the increase in commodity prices globally.

2022-04-19,Proposal to exempt SPACs from 'shell company' tag,"Under Companies Act, every company needs to carry out business after incorporation, failing which the name of the company will be struck off. This rule is aimed at curbing the creation of shell companies which do not undertake any business but are used as a front for illegal activities.","The proposal comes as other regulators in the country are also working on special rules for SPACs.The corporate affairs ministry has proposed to exempt special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) from the 'shell company' provisions. In its 'Company Law Committee Report 2022', the ministry proposed to give legal status to SPAC entities and exempt them from the requirement applicable to companies regarding business operations. 

Under Companies Act, every company needs to carry out business after incorporation, failing which the name of the company will be struck off. This rule is aimed at curbing the creation of shell companies which do not undertake any business but are used as a front for illegal activities.

However, SPACs are essentially blank cheque companies which don't have any intrinsic business of their own. They raise money from investors and list on stock exchanges. After this, they look for acquisition opportunities within 18 months. Usually, they buy an existing company and merge it into the SPAC. This benefits the company being acquired since it helps them list on stock exchanges without having to float a public share sale.

""The relaxation will enable companies to be set up as SPACs,"" said Moin Ladha, partner, Khaitan & Co. ""This coupled exit opportunity for dissenting shareholders of a SPAC is a welcome step towards facilitating these transactions,"" he added.

The proposal comes as other regulators in the country are also working on special rules for SPACs. For instance, International Financial Services Centre Authority (IFSCA), which regulates the entities based out of Gift City, Gujarat, has already floated draft norms for SPACs. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is also said to be working on a SPAC framework.

Market participants said if the Company Law Committee's recommendations are accepted, entities wanting to create SPACs will get much-needed regulatory clarity.

""It is a progressive step that has potential to solve several regulatory and tax concerns for companies and investors,"" said Jatin Kalra, director, Grant Thornton. ""The current regulatory environment does not permit SPACs - a concept that allows blank cheque companies to list on a stock exchange, and look for acquisition targets, allowing the target company to get listing status.""

The MPC has voted unanimously to continue with an accommodative stance to continue supporting growth. 

The Marginal standing facility (MSF) rate & bank rate remain unchanged at 4.25%. The width of liquidity adjustment facilities, i.e. LAF corridor will be restored to 50 basis points - the position that prevailed before the pandemic.

The RBI today also introduced a standing deposit facility at 3.75%, aimed at liquidity management. With this, the RBI has restored the LAF corridor with SDF at the base at 3.75% and MSF at 4.25%. The Fixed Reverse Repo Rate has been kept at 3.35% and along with SDF will impart flexibility to RBI's liquidity management, the governor said.

â€œRBI revises its stance to less accommodative to revive, sustain growth and contain inflation,â€ RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said. ""Global food prices have hardened significantly.

Growth & inflation outlook
India's GDP growth projection has been downgraded to 7.2% for FY23, from 7.8% forecasted in the previous meet. The RBI sees 16.2% real GDP growth in Q1FY23, 6.2% in Q2, 4.1% in Q3, and Q4 at 4%. The growth projections assume crude oil at $100 per barrel in the ongoing fiscal.

Governor Das announced that the inflation for the current fiscal is now projected at 5.7%, up from the 4.5% forecast in the February meeting. Q1FY23 inflation is now seen at 6.3%, Q2 at 5%, Q3 at 5.4%, and Q4 at 5.1%.

He said that given the volatility since February, any projection related to growth and inflation is fraught with risks and is contingent on future oil and commodity price developments.

""Economic activity, although recovering, is barely above its pre-pandemic level. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to retain repo rate at 4% and remain accommodative,"" Das said. ""It (MPC) also decided to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure inflation remains within the target while supporting growth,"" he added.

The RBI has cut its key lending rate, i.e, the repo rate by 115 bps since March 2020 to support the economy in the face of economic fallout from the pandemic. It last cut its policy rate on May 22, 2020, in an off-policy cycle when COVID-19 posed an unprecedented challenge to the economy.

The three state-owned general insurance players will have to meet certain regulatory milestones, set by the regulator to be able to get fund infusion, Irdai Member (Non-life) T M Alamelu said on Thursday. 

""For these three public sector general insurance companies, we have asked for revised business plans. The fund infusion would depend on their compliance with certain milestones we have laid out so that there is a calibrated way of coming out of this situation,"" Alamelu told reporters. 

She, along with Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India chairman Debasish Panda and other senior officials, met CEOs and other key officials of life, general, health insurers and reinsurers in Mumbai. 

Irdai chairman said the government has asked for some information on state-owned general insurance companies from Irdai and the same has been shared with them. 

""The government is very much aware of the present financials of insurance companies. The regulator has given some forbearance with the advice also that may be they have to infuse more capital in order to perform better,"" Panda said.

 Private sector players in Russia have met with potential suppliers in India's big cities and are opening specialised bank accounts at home for roubles-to-rupees transactions, with the blessing of the two governments, the sources said.

 As the Ukraine conflict drags on and sanctions tighten around Russia's economy, the stakes have risen both for Russian businesses needing overseas goods and for big global companies wanting to avoid those businesses, lest they run afoul of sanction rules.

 In India, one of the most prominent world economies to continue trade with Russia, this has put the spotlight on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a potential trade route that, while limited in size, could remain under the sanctions radar.

 ""It is absolutely clear that large Indian conglomerates having exposure to the West will not conduct business with Russian companies,"" said a senior Indian foreign ministry official based in New Delhi.

 ""But SMEs can export and settle payments through banks that are not under the Western sanctions regime.""

 The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said representatives from Russian chambers of commerce were travelling to New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru to identify companies willing to set up new subsidiaries or joint ventures to export goods to Russia.

 They are especially seeking consumer durables, spare parts for the transport sector, medical devices, construction materials for large infrastructure projects, and frozen food ahead of the winter season, the official said.

 Among them was a Russian trader in Mumbai this week to meet exporters of vegetables and spare parts for the public transport sector.

 ""We are not facing any food shortages right now but it is critical to secure a steady supply chain in the next 60 days,"" the trader said.

 Three other senior government officials and one banking official based in New Delhi, Moscow and St. Petersburg said Russian companies were actively opening accounts in Commercial-Indo Bank LLC, a joint venture between two Indian banks with headquarters in Moscow.

 ROUBLES-TO-RUPEES
 These so-called Nostro accounts, used in the Soviet era mainly to settle international transactions by converting home currency to a foreign currency, provided a direct roubles-to-rupees payment mechanism for trade between the two countries when tensions were high between Washington and Moscow.

 Officials at the Commercial-Indo Bank and its two parent banks, the State Bank of India and Canara Bank , did not respond to questions from Reuters.

 The Indian embassy in Moscow and Russia's industry and trade ministry declined to comment. India's trade and foreign ministry did not comment.

 A senior government official with close knowledge of the matter in New Delhi added that Russia was offering dedicated ships for cargo along with insurance and re-insurance, since no European bank would provide it, although sources at India's finance and foreign ministries said terms were still under discussion.

 New Delhi has not joined the widespread condemnation of Russia, its second-largest supplier of defence equipment and a valued source of oil imports, as well as a potential export market.

 ""But it is critical to ensure that the West does not get upset with India's increased economic involvement, as New Delhi cannot jeopardise its ties with the West,"" said Nandan Unnikrishnan, the head of Eurasian Studies at Observer Research Foundation, a private-sector think tank.

 India's total merchandise trade with Russia is relatively modest, at about $8.1 billion in 2021 or about 1.2% of India's total trade, although two Indian officials estimated that exports to Russia would rise by more than $500 million in the next three months, as trade channels open up for small Indian businesses.

 An Indian exporter in Kolkata, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that after war broke out many traders stopped dealing with Russian buyers, fearing defaults, but their wariness was easing.

 ""People have started selling goods to Russia again, and in the past few weeks Russia has ramped up purchases of tea and coffee.""

2022-04-23,It's time to raise policy rates rather than change stance,The main role for monetary policy through a nominal anchor such as CPI is to deliver low and stable long run inflation and IE.,"AgenciesFirst phase of the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) for India started in August 2016 and the next in April 2021, which is due to run till March 2026. The inflation target was renewed with the CPI target kept at 4%, with the upper tolerance level at 6% and the lower tolerance at 2%. The 2016 notification indicated, among other things that, the key advantage around a target was that it would accommodate unanticipated short-term shocks even while nudging Inflation Expectations (IE) to the centre of the range to which monetary policy will return the economy over the medium term.

The main role for monetary policy through a nominal anchor such as CPI is to deliver low and stable long run inflation and IE. Even as we have seen stable inflation since the start of FIT, IE continue to remain high and sticky. In this regard, it would be useful to look at the bi-monthly Household Inflation Expectations Survey published by the central bank. The key statistics here, include the 3 month and 1 year ahead median inflation expectations. Let's take a look at the data for 3 periods: May 2016 to March 2021 (first phase of FIT); April 2021 to March 2022 (second phase of FIT that concludes in March 2026); May 2016 to March 2022 (whole period till now where FIT has been implemented).

During the period of the FIT, IE has remained above 7% persistently, which is 1% above the upper tolerance level of 6% and has been closer to the high single digits for both the 3 month and 1 year ahead IE.

For the whole period, while the minimum three month and one year ahead IE at 7.2 and 7.9 have been above the upper tolerance level of 6%, in the second phase of FIT the three month and one year ahead IE have been significantly higher than the upper tolerance level of 6%. It would be interesting to go to the root causes of such high IE in the backdrop of six years of a FIT regime. While food and fuel prices could be a proximate cause, could it be that past episodes, prior to FIT, of high and entrenched inflation has led to an element of IE stickiness. Could the trump card to escape this entrenched IE lie with increased productivity through fiscal policy, which can complement FIT? Clearly, the thrust by the government through capex could be beneficial and transformative in this regard. Even as productivity changes take time and are structural, near term cyclical dynamics call for restrictive monetary policy. The real rates are negative when adjusted for IE.

There has been a considerable shift in inflation forecasts from 4.5% in the Feb policy (with risks characterised as broadly balanced) to 5.7% in the April policy. Given the structural up move in global commodity prices and supply chain effects, inflation in India could be in the region of 6% and above 6% for three successive quarters. A simple Taylor rule that captures inflation deviations from target; output gap and a real rate could provide some intuition to likely policy rate outcomes. 

Rates could go above 6% based on policy or 7% based on an alternative forecast especially in the backdrop of CPI at 6.95% and WPI at 14.55%. It would be useful to hike rates soon rather than move from accommodative to neutral followed by policy action. In this regard the period October 2019 to February 2020 could be useful in that, policy moved to calibrated tightening in October 2019 which remained in February 2020 when rates were cut (and policy moved to neutral). The current environment calls for moves the other way around.

Finally, since more liquidity is drained for 14 days which is characterised as the main operation it would be interesting to start thinking about a transition of the policy rate from overnight to a 14-day main operation rate in the backdrop of a tightening cycle.

2022-04-12,About 29% Indian households downgraded edible oil: Report,"One in two households is absorbing the impact of rising prices by dipping into their savings, and consumers have demanded Government intervention on black marketing, hoarding, unfair trade practices and even capping of trade margins on edible oil, the report by community social media platform LocalCircles said.","AgenciesAbout 29% Indian households have downgraded the edible oil they use, while 17% have cut down on discretionary spending, with escalation in raw material prices, a new report said.

One in two households is absorbing the impact of rising prices by dipping into their savings, and consumers have demanded government intervention on black marketing, hoarding, unfair trade practices and even capping of trade margins on edible oil, the report by community social media platform LocalCircles said.

This report said intervention of the government would ensure manufacturers donâ€™t charge inflated prices from consumers. LocalCircles will escalate the findings of this study to stakeholders in the government, it added.

Prices of cooking oils including sunflower, peanut oil and canola have risen 50-70% over pre-Covid levels, escalated by the ongoing geopolitical tension.

India imports about 85% of soybean oil from Argentina and Brazil, 90% of sunflower oil is imported from Russia and Ukraine, while Indonesia and Malaysia are major exporters of palm oil to India.

The report said the price surge in edible oils continues to upset householdsâ€™ budgets and consumption patterns. In December last year, the government reduced import duty on refined palm oil to 12.5% from 17.5% to rein in the prices of the commodity. But despite the average contribution of edibles oilsâ€™ inflation to overall food inflation declined to 1.3% from 3% in FY-21, prices of these commodities remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels.

With prices of edible oil having risen steeply over the last 12 months, half the households said they are consuming the same amount as before and paying more each month from savings. The report flagged that the rise in prices of edible oils is forcing low and middle income households to opt for cheaper and low-quality oils, which could potentially lead to health risks.

2022-04-25,Delhi HC stays Punjab & Sind Bank from taking further action on Srei,"In a relief to Srei Group and its founder Hemant Kanoria, the Delhi High Court has ordered Punjab & Sind Bank to restrain itself from taking any further action on the company.","ETBFSIIn a relief to Srei Group and its founder Hemant Kanoria, the Delhi High Court has ordered Punjab & Sind Bank to restrain itself from taking any further action on the company.

This comes after a recent classification of Srei loans as fraud by the state-owned lender, which took its decision on the basis of a forensic audit report by KPMG. 

The lender had on April 19 declared the two Srei group loan accounts as frauds, following which Kanoria made a petition against the bank.

""Till the next date, the respondent no.1 bank (Punjab & Sind Bank in this case) will stand restrained from taking any further steps or action prejudicial to the petitioner on the basis of the order declaring the petitionerâ€™s bank account as fraud,"" Justice Rekha Palli said in her order dated April 22.

People close to the Kanoria family expect that the court order would act as a deterrent and ""nip any such effort by other lending banks from acting unilaterally and in haste in reclassifying Srei loans -- based on KPMG forensic report that has been challenged in court"".

Punjab & Sind Bank had declared both the non-performing loan accounts of Srei Infrastructure Finance and SREI Equipment Finance as frauds and reported these to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as per regulation. This is despite the promoter's challenge against the KMPG report. Kanoria had also urged the Reserve Bank of India to advise banks not to take any step against the companies as the matter is sub judice. 

The latest Delhi High Court order also noted that the issue raised in the present petition is already pending adjudication in a batch of petitions before Judge Prateek Jalan which are now listed on May 2.

Srei Infrastructure has an outstanding due of Rs 510 crore to Punjab & Sind Bank. The dues of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Srei Equipment Finance, run to Rs 724 crore.

The two Srei companies, with total outstanding dues of nearly Rs 32,000 crore are undergoing insolvency proceedings. The RBI appointed administrator has received â€˜expression of interestâ€™ from bidders such as Vedanta, Jindal Power, Asset Reconstruction Company (India), JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company, and Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors.

The National Company Law Tribunal approved a consolidated corporate insolvency resolution process for the two debt-laden companies.

The KPMG report pointed out that Rs 8,158 crore of loans were given by the Srei companies to â€œconnected partiesâ€. They included â€œrefinancingâ€ of loans to â€œevergreenâ€ them, and disbursal of low-interest loans of long moratorium to multiple borrowers â€œwithout adequate justification.â€

2022-06-23,"Kharif sowing picks up, next fortnight crucial",Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its forecast for next five days has said gradual maximum temperature is likely to rise by 2-4 degree centigrade over most parts of northwest India and Madhya Pradesh. ,"AgenciesRepresentative ImageSowing of kharif crops like soyabean, paddy, cotton has picked up in the country amid an advancing monsoon, and rainfall over the next fortnight will be crucial, agriculture experts said. 

Some places such as Malwa in Madhya Pradesh and a few districts in Maharashtra are yet to get enough rainfall for sowing soyabean while there is a rush among farmers in Gujarat for sowing cotton in anticipation of good returns. In Haryana, intermittent pre-monsoon rains have helped farmers to sow paddy crop. Paddy farmers in Bengal, too, are sowing.

â€œAs of today, monsoon has been decent for sowing soyabean crop, though in Malwa region there is lesser rainfall which is impacting sowing,â€ said D N Pathak, executive director of Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA). â€œBut we have time till first week of July. If it rains in this fortnight, then sowing will pick up in the region too.â€

According to government data, as on June 10, kharif crop has been sown in 79.62 lakh hectares of land. 

In last kharif, India had produced 127.20 lakh tonnes of soyabean, according to the first advance estimates of agriculture ministry.

Kharif cotton sowing for the season in Gujarat is likely to increase by at least 15% compared to the previous season amid a rush to sow the crop well ahead of its schedule, industry executives said. Farmers had got good prices for cotton in domestic and international markets last season.

Vijay Setia, a basmati rice producer from Haryana, said there has been intermittent pre-monsoon rains in the state for last three to four days, which has helped farmers to sow the basmati crop.

In Bengal, the largest producer of non-basmati rice in the country, farmers have started sowing in places that have received good rainfall. â€œThere have been good rains in last three days. Farmers of Bengal had started sowing and the rains have added further momentum,â€ said Subrata Mondol, general secretary of Burdwan District Rice Mills Association.

In Kharif 2021, India had produced 107.04 million tonnes of rice. 

Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its forecast for next five days has said gradual maximum temperature is likely to rise by 2-4 degree centigrade over most parts of northwest India and Madhya Pradesh. Between June 27 and 29, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is likely over peninsular India and east India, while there could be an increase in rainfall over northwest and central India, it said.

In the Russia-Ukraine situation, the optimist believes that there will be some political solution as Russia can't be ignored and placed under sanctions but the pessimist is saying that there will be a further escalation and this could even lead to higher fatalities, Shah said in an interview with ETMarkets.com.

Sharing his outlook, he said that this is the market where valuations are fair and are in line with the historical average valuation. Investors should maintain neutral or equal weight asset allocation.

â€œThere might be a further correction in the market if the events donâ€™t turn out as expected by the optimists. Donâ€™t rush, buy in one go, and average at that point in time,â€ he added.

""We donâ€™t have the ability to say which way markets will go. Be a long-term investor and follow the â€˜dharmaâ€™ of asset allocation,â€ the veteran asset manager said.

Talking about earnings, he said it is now dominated by commodities and cyclical companies. â€œCurrently, many companies are not able to pass the price rise to the consumers. For the June 2022 quarter, the topline will be higher due to inflationary pressures but margins will get squeezed. We maintain Rs 825-875 EPS for Nifty50 companies in FY23,â€ he said.

""The quality of earnings is changing. Earlier, earnings were dominated by IT, pharma, banking, and financial services but now it is dominated by commodities and cyclical companies like metals. You will have to not only look at the quality of earnings but also the quantum of earnings and with this uncertainty, it is a bit difficult to say which way it will go,"" he added.

Shah also gave a few inspiring examples to motivate the young and new stock market investors on Dalal Street. ""I still vividly remember Anil Kumble wearing a plaster and balling to Brian Lara despite being hit by a fast bowler. He had a fracture in his jaw but he ended up taking the wicket of Brian Lara in the end. Something similar also happened with Sachin Tendulkar as well,"" Shah highlighted.

""Likewise, investors have to suffer losses in the markets as well. Bull and bear markets are part of the investment journey. Don't worry about the temporary losses and continue investing,"" he added.

The market veteran also highlighted that India is trading at a significant premium to its peer group. ""We are probably twice more expensive than China, twice more expensive than Brazil, twice more expensive than South Africa and infinitely expensive to Russia as their markets have corrected. Our ESG ranking, governance standards, environmental and social consciousness is significantly better than our peer group. So we will trade at a premium but sustaining today's premium over the emerging market looks a bit doubtful,"" he said.

He further added that FII outflows are likely to continue and the near-term uncertainties are pushing people to take the profit out of India. However, Shah also believes that India is a 
â€˜lambi race ka ghodaâ€™.

2022-06-25,Wall Street mints big gains to end strong week,Stocks rebounded this week as financial markets have been roiled over worries that rapid rate hikes by the Fed to rein in 40-year-high inflation could cause a recession.,"APFor the week, the S&P 500 rose 6.4%, the Dow added 5.4%, the Nasdaq gained 7.5%.Wall Street's main indexes soared on Friday in a broad rally as signs of slowing economic growth and a recent pullback in commodity prices tempered expectations for the Federal Reserve's rate-hike plans.

 The S&P 500 rose over 3% for its biggest one-day percentage rise since May 2020. All 11 of the benchmark index's sectors ended at least 1.5% higher.

 Stocks rebounded this week as financial markets have been roiled over worries that rapid rate hikes by the Fed to rein in 40-year-high inflation could cause a recession.

 Still, investors have been gauging when the market might hit its bottom after the benchmark S&P 500 earlier this month recorded a 20% drop from its January closing peak, confirming the common definition of a bear market.

 ""Some of the moves, the sellers just get exhausted so you don't have as much capital moving out,"" said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist at TD Ameritrade.

 ""This might be a little bit of a relief rally,"" Cruz said. ""But I think I would not encourage anyone to start going in with both hands at the moment, because we have seen this repeatedly where these things can reverse themselves pretty quickly.""

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 823.32 points, or 2.68%, to 31,500.68, the S&P 500 gained 116.01 points, or 3.06%, to 3,911.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 375.43 points, or 3.34%, to 11,607.62.

 For the week, the S&P 500 rose 6.4%, the Dow added 5.4%, the Nasdaq gained 7.5%.

 Volume surged towards the end of the session as the close of trading marked the completion of FTSE Russell's reconstitution of its indexes that are tracked by trillions of dollars in investor funds.

 U.S. consumer sentiment fell to a record low in June, but Americans saw a marginal improvement in the outlook for inflation, a survey showed on Friday. Data on Thursday pointed to slowing U.S. business activity in June.

 Helping ease inflation fears was a sharp drop in commodity prices this week. The Refinitiv/CoreCommodity Index, which measures prices for energy, agriculture, metals and other commodities, fell to a roughly two-month low on Thursday after hitting a multi-year peak earlier in June.

 Fed funds futures traders are now pricing for the benchmark rate to rise to about 3.5% by March, down from expectations last week that it would increase to around 4%.

 ""The expectation of future rate hikes coming down is part of the equation that makes today's equity market so strong,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

 Bank stocks rallied, with the S&P 500 banks index rising 3.7%, after the Fed's annual ""stress test"" exercise showed that the lenders have enough capital to weather a severe economic downturn.

 In company news, FedEx Corp shares jumped 7.2% after the parcel delivery company issued a stronger-than-expected full-year profit forecast.

 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

 The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 29 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 86 new lows.

 More than 19 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 12.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

In the last one year, Nifty Bank index has delivered a better-than-FD return of 8 per cent but the Nifty PSU Bank index has outperformed with a 35 per cent return. On a year-to-date basis, the PSU Bank index has rallied over 8 per cent against a flat Nifty Bank.

While ICICI Bank, which is now turning into a favourite of many investors on the back of improving margins and asset quality, has given a return of 20 per cent in the last one year, PSU banks like State Bank of India (SBI) have rallied 41 per cent, Bank of Baroda 73 per cent, Canara Bank 68 per cent and Indian Bank 44 per cent during the same period.

On the other hand, HDFC Bank has eroded nearly 7 per cent of its value in the last one year. Kotak Mahindra Bank is down 2 per cent. Bandhan Bank too has underperformed with a nominal return of just 1 per cent during the period.

'Big Bull' Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who bought a stake in Canara Bank last year, hiked his shareholding to 1.96 per cent last quarter. Earlier in February, he had said the rerating in PSU stocks had just started and that PSU banks will outperform private sector banks by a wide margin going ahead.

Sandeep Tandon, CIO, Quant Mutual Fund, says PSU banks have the potential to outperform private sector banks. ""So we like to keep our portfolio more skewed towards public sector banks as a strategy, rather than keeping skewed towards the private sector,"" Tandon said.

Global brokerage CLSA prefers corporate banks, which include large PSU banks as well. ""We still see enough opportunity in the large corporate side of banks because a lot of these saw a pretty long de-rating through a large part of the last decade when there was a long balance sheet deleveraging cycle. So it is really a kind of mean reversion. The worst part of that balance sheet worry is behind us and their performance is clearly improving,"" CLSA's Vikash Kumar Jain said.

He said retail banks have become very expensive and are seeing some kind of mean reversion in their valuations.

Anshul Saigal of Kotak Mahindra AMC says that during the 2014-2020 cycle, PSU banks and corporate banks had got de-rated but the cycle has now reversed. Selective PSU bank stocks, as well as large private sector banks, should do well this year, he adds.

Sudip Bandyopadhyay of Inditrade Capital recommends aggressive buyers to look at PNB and Bank of Baroda (BoB). ""I will not try to venture into smaller PSU banks. If you are an aggressive investor, PNB and BoB are definitely worth buying because the upside from here at the current level looks pretty realistic in the medium to short term.""

The S&P BSE Sensex fell by nearly 200 points while the Nifty50 managed to close above 16,500 levels.

Sectorally, buying was seen in capital goods, industrials, metals, banks, and public sector stocks while selling was visible in power, utilities, healthcare and realty.

Stocks that were in focus include names like Bajaj Auto which fell nearly 4 per cent, Hindustan Aeronautics which hit a fresh 52-week high, and Happiest Minds Technologies which rallied more than 9 per cent on Wednesday.


Here's what Vijay Dhanotiya, Lead Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Bajaj Auto: BuyBajaj Auto might have fallen but the momentum oscillators conditional to bullish market continuation is still intact. The two-wheeler maker remains a good buy on dips around Rs 4,050 level.

Moving average indicator and 200-day EMA make it a strong buy in the short term. Bajaj Auto has also shown a rise in monthly sales numbers for May which highlights a revival in the auto sector.


HAL: BuyAfter the quarterly result, HAL is giving fantastic movement. It has already broken the key level of Rs 1,900. The company reported strong results for the quarter ended March.

On Wednesday, it rose by about 3 per cent and in the upcoming trading sessions, we can expect further upside movement.

There is a major psychological level of Rs 2,000 which it can test in the upcoming days. On the downside, a level of Rs 1,700 can act as a support level.


Happiest Minds: BuyThere was an excellent swing in Happiest Minds in the last 1-2 trading sessions. Since July 2021, we saw an almost 50% price correction in the stock.

However, considering global IT tech socks, there was a good recovery in Indian midcap stocks as well and Happiest mind was one of them.

On Wednesday, we saw a 10 per cent jump in the stock. Although it is trading near its resistance level, but if it sustains above the level of Rs 1,000, then we can expect the levels of Rs 1,040-1,070.

2022-06-18,Money expansion during slowdown period is not inflationary: RBI Research Paper,"When the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, implying that monetary accommodation during Covid-19 by the central bank needs to be reversed once the economy gets back to its normal path of growth.","ANIMumbai: It is said that too much money chasing too few goods is inflationary. But that may be only partially true. Empirical results of a study by economists at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation in the presence of economic slack.

When the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, implying that monetary accommodation during Covid-19 by the central bank needs to be reversed once the economy gets back to its normal path of growth.

Well known economist and Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman's theory which guided monetary policy through the world in the second half of twentieth century said that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and it occurs when too much money chases too few goods. Excess money creation, or unrestrained expansion in the balance sheet size of a central bank, accordingly, has been cited as the prime driver of inflation.

But that is changing since the turn of the twentieth century across the globe and the link between money supply and inflation is weakening - even in India. Empirical results suggest that money growth does not pose risks to inflation during an economic slack. When the economy is in an expansionary phase, however, an increase in money supply can cause higher inflation, said a research paper carried in the latest RBI bulletin.

The authors are Sitikantha Pattanaik, Binod B. Bhoi and Harendra Kumar Behera, from the Department of Economic and Policy Research. The results of the research are that of the authors from the RBI's economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself.

""Empirical findings for India suggest that excess liquidity that does not lead to higher broad money growth is not inflationary,"" the authors said. ""Only a robust pick-up in demand that can absorb the surplus liquidity in the system could be inflationary.""

The research assumes significance as central banks across the globe that were in quantitative easing mode post global financial crisis in 2008 and went on aggressively expanding their balance sheets are now going for quantitative tightening. Back home in India, the RBI is being criticised for falling behind the curve in its inflation fight.

The authors say that higher money growth may counterbalance the contractionary impact of the velocity shock rather than pose risks to inflation. Also, Friedman's theory is increasingly less likely to hold in the age of financial innovations, rising digital non-cash modes of payments for transactions and also in view of the emergence of FinTech for financial intermediation.

At present, he is Director (strategy) at Estee Advisors and head of investments at Gulaq, a part of Estee Group.Investing in the stock market is becoming luring for people. Many of us think of it as a tool to get quickly rich. What investors lack is discipline and patience to stay in the market for the long term.

To stay invested for a longer tenure, one needs to understand the right way of observing the market.

The market is no easy play, as not everything you see may be correct and vice versa.
ETMarkets Smart Talk: Srikanth Subramanian decodes factors that could derail momentum on D-St

The correct way to look at the market returns:
We usually look at average historical returns as a primary activity before investing. This way of finding better avenues to invest is not totally correct. It doesnâ€™t consider every factor about the returns, thus may give an incorrect picture.

Looking only at the average market returns at a particular point in time may give a biased result. You may end up having too high or too low expectations. Over a period of time, stock prices show volatility.

One of the ways to look at the market returns with accuracy is â€˜Rolling returnsâ€™. Rolling returns guide investors on the range of returns that are expected, showing the highest return, lowest return, and average return for a given time period.

Letâ€™s understand the concept of Rolling returns by the following example.

Looking at the image below, if you consider the period of one year beginning from January 2016 to December 2016, the market gave a return of 12% in the year.

Instead, an investor started investing in February 2016, his return was 20% at the end of one year in January 2017. Someone lucky might have started investing in March 2016 and completed one year in February 2017 with a return of 25%.

Thus, these different one-year periods show the series of possible market returns in a year.


ET CONTRIBUTORS
Looking only at the average returns may prove to be misguiding for the investors. The whole picture may differ. For example, the Nifty 50 gave a 14% average market return for the last five years.

This does not give the whole picture of an investor who has 5 years investment horizon. Another noteworthy thing is the highest return for five years was 75% and the lowest return for the five years was 2%.

Apparently, the time period of above five years has the lowest return in a positive number. Therefore, it is evident that the larger the time frame, the higher the possibility of positive returns and a low risk of losing capital.

Defining tenure can be a subjective term for investing, but one can follow this general definition to understand the difference.


What do Long-term investing and Short-term investing mean?
Generally, Long-term investing means staying invested in any financial asset for more than one year. On the other hand, short-term investing means staying invested in the same financial asset for a period of lesser than one year. Though, these definitions are only correct from a taxation perspective.

Individual definitions of long term and short term may differ for all of us. For some, it may be just a year, but for others, the long term can be 10 years.


ET CONTRIBUTORS
Looking at the above chart, we can see that there are almost 100% chance of positive returns if one stays invested for at least 5 years. Hence when thinking about investing for long term, one should have minimum time horizon of 5 years, though more the better.


Why Long-term investing is a better option?

1. Less time-consuming
One of the major benefits of investing for the long-term is you do not need to constantly monitor your investment. In short-term investing, you constantly need to monitor the price movements. This requires more time and huge effort.

On the other hand, long-term investing gives you a hassle-free experience. Once you selected the fundamentally strong stocks, you can choose to stay relaxed. You just need to periodically check their performance.


2. Higher returns due to compounding
Compounding, which was called the â€˜eighth wonder of the worldâ€™ by Albert Einstein, has phenomenal power. This element enters into the game of long-term investing if dividends and stock returns over time are reinvested. The larger the investment horizon, the higher the power of compounding and vice versa.

Suppose Harshit and Ronak, and Meet invest Rs. 5,00,000 on the same day in the same stock and earn the same interest of 10%. All of them decided to stay invested for 12 years. Harshit thought of withdrawing the interest every year, whereas Ronak and Meet chose to reinvest the interest.

Harshit who chose to withdraw the interest every year would receive Rs. 11,00,000 at the end of 12 years. Whereas, Ronak and Meet would receive Rs. 15, 69,214 at the end of 12 years.

Now, Meet wants to stay invested for further 3 years and wants to keep reinvesting the interest. At the end of his 15 years of investment, he would receive Rs. 20,88,624 even with the same rate of interest. This shows the real power of compounding.


3. No burden of timing the market
Short-term investing requires a trader to time the market. The practice of timing the market can make huge money, on the one hand, the investors may end up losing huge on the other due to wrong anticipation. Due to the fact that the â€˜Future is uncertainâ€™, predicting the market exactly is impossible.

If you are a long-term investor, you can be free of the stress of predicting future price movements and taking entry and exit decisions frequently.


4. Negligible impact of short-term fluctuations
Price fluctuation is inherently in the nature of the stock market. This tends to bring in human emotions, and investors may end up taking wrong decisions looking at such fluctuations. The recent Russia vs Ukraine crisis is one example. â€˜Volatilityâ€™, which is a big part of the picture of short-term investing, is a very small part of long-term investing. The large picture of long-term investing allows investors to avoid such short-term fluctuations.


Points to take care of when invested for the long term
Following are the points you should take care of while invested for the long term.

â€¢ Keeping yourself updated about the news is not bad but taking entry or exiting from funds on such short-term news can impact your long-term investment.
â€¢ Do not expect to get your return doubled in a very short span of a month or even a year.
â€¢ Do not think of beating the benchmarks, in terms of return, all the time. If you are investing with discipline and consistency, beating the benchmark would be of little account in the long term.
â€¢ Do not make any decision with emotional bias or intuition. Rely more on data than anything else.

To sum up, long-term investing is a key to unlocking huge potential returns. Though long-term investing is the plant that you do not need to water daily but taking care of it periodically is important.

 After ending Monday firmer, Nasdaq futures lost 1.3% with traders blaming an earnings warning from Snap which saw shares in the Snapchat owner tumble 28%.

 S&P 500 futures also lost 0.6%, surrendering some of Monday's 1.8% bounce.

 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was left almost flat as a result, while Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.1%.

 Markets have taken some comfort from U.S. President Joe Biden's comment that he was considering easing sanctions on China, and from Beijing's ongoing promises of stimulus.

 Unfortunately, China's zero-COVID policy, with attendant lockdowns, has already done considerable economic damage. 

 ""Following disappointing April activity data, we have downgraded our China GDP (gross domestic product) forecast again and now look for 2Q GDP to contract 5.4% annualised, previously â€’1.5%,"" warned analysts at JPMorgan.

 ""Our 2Q global growth forecast stands at just 0.6% annualised rate, easily the weakest quarter since the global financial crisis outside of 2020."" 

 Early surveys of European and U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers for May are due out later on Tuesday and could show some slowing in what has been a resilient sector of the global economy.

 Analysts have also been trimming forecasts for the United States given the Federal Reserve seems certain to hike interest rates by a full percentage point over the next two months.

 The hawkish message is likely to be driven home this week by a host of Fed speakers and minutes of the last policy meeting due on Wednesday.

 Yet the European Central Bank is also turning more hawkish, with President Christine Lagarde surprising many by opening the door for a rate rise as early as July.

 That saw the euro up at $1.0685, having bounced 1.2% overnight in its best session since early March. It now faces stiff chart resistance around $1.0756.

 The dollar also retreated versus sterling and a range of currencies, taking the dollar index down 0.9% overnight and back to 102.100.

 Meanwhile the euro jumped sharply to 136.56 Japanese yen, while the dollar held steady at 127.77 yen.

 The pullback in the dollar helped gold regain some ground to $1,853 an ounce. [GOL/]

 Oil prices were caught between worries over a possible global downturn and the prospect of higher fuel demand from the U.S. summer driving season and Shanghai's plans to reopen after a two-month coronavirus lockdown. [O/R]

2022-04-06,Rakesh Gangwal ropes in 4 investment banks to manage his stake sale in IndiGo,"Late last year, IndiGo's shareholders approved a change in the company's Articles of Association, enabling Gangwal to sell his holding without co-founder Rahul Bhatia's approval.","Rakesh Gangwal, cofounder of IndiGo, has asked Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan to manage the planned sale of his shares in the airline, banking sources told ET.

He may sell at least 5-7% of his family's shareholding in India's biggest air carrier this year, they added. 

Gangwal, his wife Shobha and their family trust together hold 36.6% stake in InterGlobe Aviation, the parent entity of IndiGo, whose market capitalisation touched â‚¹76,767 crore as of market close on Tuesday. Their combined stake could be worth as much as â‚¹28,097 crore.


Management Churn on Since Feb 
 Meanwhile, long-time suitor Qatar Airways is also believed to have wooed Gangwal for a substantial stake, according to market participants.

Gangwal stepped down from InterGlobe Aviation's board in mid-February and said he would sell his stake over five years. 

The selloff, sources said, is intended to take advantage of an upswing in the aviation sector following the lows of the Covid-19 pandemic.




Late last year, IndiGo's shareholders approved a change in the company's Articles of Association, enabling Gangwal to sell his holding without co-founder Rahul Bhatia's approval.

Gangwal and Bhatia had been locked in a bitter legal feud for the past several years over allegations of misuse of power and related-party transactions. Gangwal, once a hands-on promoter, had refused to participate in key purchase decisions in 2018 and subsequently took a backseat on all operational aspects, till he stepped down in February. Bhatia took over as managing director the same month.

Since then, there has been a management churn at the airline.

On Monday, IndiGo announced the appointment of former bureaucrat RK Singh as principal advisor to the managing director. Singh was a joint secretary in the ministry of civil aviation and has served on the boards of Air India, Indian Airlines, Alliance Air, and Air India Charters Ltd (Air India Express). 


Another Exec to Exit Soon

IndiGo's chief commercial officer Willy Boulter will also leave in July, marking the second top-level exit this year after chief financial officer Jiten Chopra was replaced by senior vice president Gaurav Negi last Wednesday.

The numbers though beat analysts' muted projections.

Analysts said near to medium term growth would remain under pressure due to regulatory issues, slow recovery in the API business and inflated costs, but felt the recent correction on the counter has made valuations reasonable. They have price targets that suggest flat to 30 per cent potential upside on the counter.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his better half Rekha held 6.8 per cent stake in this drug maker as of March 31, up from 6.3 per cent in the December quarter.

The company reported a 72 per cent drop in profit at Rs 59.55 crore for the March quarter compared with Rs 213.90 crore. Revenue for the quarter fell 3.9 per cent to Rs 1,524.57 crore from Rs 1,586.47 crore YoY. Ebitda margin stood at 16.2 per cent, down 752 basis points YoY.

Among the key segments, generics sales fell 29 per cent YoY and accounted for 14 per cent of sales for the quarter. The import alert at its Roorkee site, pricing pressure in the US, and lower Remdesivir sales impacted its performance in generics, Motilal Oswal said.

Contract development and manufacturing operations (CDMO) sales declined 19 per cent and accounted for 31 per cent of sales, as Covid-related deals tapered off.

Specialty pharma, which accounted for 45 per cent sales, grew 15 per cent while sales from contract research and development services (9 per cent of sales), grew 51 per cent YoY.

Near term drivers are weak, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, while suggesting a couple of medium to long term business drivers including reorganisation of API and drug discovery businesses into a single entity should help the company build a larger scale. The reorganisation is expected to be completed in July.

""In the long term, we see the ongoing capacity expansion (US$92mn investment) in the CMO business adding value post FY24. The generics business can recover once the import order on the Roorkee facility is lifted. Radiopharma can surprise on the upside in the medium term, led by their efforts in building an innovative pipeline. The most near term target is MIBG, which is being evaluated in Phase 2/3 trials,"" Nirmal Bang said while suggesting a target of Rs 532 on the counter.

Crude oil movement
Amid worries that rising interest rates could push the world economy into recession, crude oil posted the second weekly decline last week. Brent crude settled at $113.12 a barrel.


F&O ExpiryThanks to the scheduled expiry of June month derivatives contracts on Thursday, volatility is expected to remain this week as well.

FII exodusAmid rising interest rates, FIIs have withdrawn Rs 2.13 lakh crore from equities so far in 2022. This month alone, the figure is nearing the Rs 46,000 crore mark.

Although domestic investors have been absorbing most of the outflow by foreign investors, FIIs remain a key player in the Indian market.


Auto sales dataAuto stocks would be in focus this week as automakers will start reporting their June month sale figures from June 1. Last week, the Nifty Auto index had rallied 6.95 per cent on the back of softening commodity prices.

Technical Outlook
On the weekly chart, Nifty has formed a bullish harami candlestick pattern. Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking, said Nifty is currently hovering around the resistance zone of 15,700 levels and is likely to face stiff resistance around the 15,900-16,250 zone if the rebound extends further.

2022-06-17,Indian yield curve suggests tightening ahead,"""The yield curve is indicating an improvement in long-term growth prospects and an upshift in ex-ante inflation expectations. At the same time, the fact that the yield curve has become steeper and concave reconfirms expectations of tighter monetary policy in the period ahead,"" the researchers said.","Mumbai: A study of the Indian yield curve from the Covid-19 pandemic times indicates that the long-term growth prospects of the Indian economy have improved and that there are expectations of a tighter monetary policy ahead, said a research paper published in the RBI monthly bulletin.

The researchers analysed government security yields with maturities of three months to 30 years for the period starting from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2022.

The empirical investigation focussed on India's pandemic experience. The slope of the yield curve steepened with the onset of pandemic-related policy easing, reversing after the recent policy tightening phase.

The researchers found that the declining level of the yield curve pointed to a contraction even before the data release in 2020-21.

""The yield curve is indicating an improvement in long-term growth prospects and an upshift in ex-ante inflation expectations. At the same time, the fact that the yield curve has become steeper and concave reconfirms expectations of tighter monetary policy in the period ahead,"" the researchers said.

The results of the research are that of the authors from the RBI's economic research department and do not reflect the views of the RBI itself, which the central bank has always maintained.

The government securities yield curve is widely regarded as a valuable predictor of future macroeconomic developments.

The research showed that in contrast to advanced economies, it is the level and curvature of the yield curve rather than its slope that contain useful information on market expectations about economic prospects and inflation expectations in India.

""The results from a yield-macro model indicate that the level and curvature of the yield curve have more information content on future macroeconomic outcomes than the slope. This finding contrasts with the received wisdom and the experience of other countries,"" the paper said.

It found that the level of the yield curve has increased since 2021 after a steep decline during the pandemic. Furthermore, the yield curve is concave compared to 2019 levels, indicative of strengthening prospects for the recovery, higher inflation expectations and hence market expectations of front-loaded monetary policy normalisation.",Positive

2022-06-22,Asian stocks stumble as Wall Street optimism peters out,Investors are continuing to assess how worried they need to be about central banks pushing the world economy into recession as they attempt to curtail red hot inflation with interest rate increases.,"APTOKYO: Asian stocks slipped in volatile trade on Wednesday, failing to extend Wall Street's rally as persistent worries about interest rates and inflation remained a key focus for investors, while the Japanese yen hit a fresh 24-year low against the dollar.

 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1%, but was still up 1.39% on the more than five-week low it hit on Monday. Tokyo's Nikkei gave up early gains and was flat.

 Investors are continuing to assess how worried they need to be about central banks pushing the world economy into recession as they attempt to curtail red hot inflation with interest rate increases.

 The main U.S. share benchmarks rose 2% overnight on the possibility the economic outlook might not be as dire as thought during trade last week when the S&P 500 logged its biggest weekly percentage decline since March 2020.

 ""I think that this recent post-holiday bear market rally is a reflection of the uncertainty that investors have regarding whether we have seen the peak of inflation and Fed hawkishness or not - I think we're close,"" said Invesco global market strategist for Asia Pacific David Chao.

 ""Even though I suspect global equity markets could end higher at the end of the year than where we are today, it's conceivable to expect continued market volatility until it becomes clear that the Fed is not going to force the U.S. economy into contraction in order to tamp down persistent levels of inflation.""

 In a sign Wall Street may not be able to repeat Tuesday's rally, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures both fell over 0.5%.

 Chinese blue chips lost 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.9% and Korea's KOSPI was down 1.78%.

 U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is due to start his testimony to Congress today with investors looking for further clues about whether another 75 basis point rate hike is on the cards at the Fed's July meeting.

 Most other global central banks are in a similar situation, apart from the Bank of Japan, which last week pledged to maintain its policy of ultra-low interest rates.

 The gap between low interest rates in Japan and rising U.S. rates has been weighing on the yen, which hit a new 24-year low of 136.71 per dollar in early trading, before drifting firmer to 136.18,

 Minutes from the Bank of Japan's April policy meeting released Wednesday showed the central bank's concerns over the impact that the plummeting currency could have on the country's business environment.

 Other currency moves were more muted on Wednesday, with the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six peers, a touch firmer at 104.6.

 The yield on benchmark U.S. 10 year Treasuries was fairly steady at 3.2674.

 Oil prices fell, with U.S. President Joe Biden expected on Wednesday to call for a temporary suspension of the 18.4-cents a gallon federal tax on gasoline, a source briefed on the plan told Reuters. Brent dropped 2.1% to $112.27 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 2.21% to $108.09.

 Spot gold dropped 0.21%, trading at $1828.70 an ounce.

 Bitcoin continued to trade around $20,640 after falling as low as $17,592 last week.

Today's fall was the sharpest fall in the stock of the luxury goods firm Titan Company in the last two years.

PMS fund manager Saurabh Mukherjea had recently said that after TCS and HDFC Bank, Titan is the third stock that can become a $1 trillion company after 10 years.

The bluechip stock has surged over 900 per cent in the last 10 years. While brokerages continue to remain bullish on this Tata group company, analysts see further selling pressure on the stock amid inflationary pressures and expensive valuations.

An average price target on the stock at Rs 2,598, as suggested by Trendlyne, hints at a potential 35 per cent upside on the counter.

Last month, Titan announced that it is aiming at a growth of 2.5 times in its flagship jewellery business in the next five years. According to the company, there is a ""huge headroom in a geographically fragmented market"", as it has only a 6 per cent market share of the Rs 4 lakh crore market.

For FY23, Titan expects a 40 per cent growth in its top line and 50 per cent in EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation).

 On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin struck back at Western sanctions on Moscow, threatening to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in roubles. The move prompted Germany, the most reliant on Russian gas, to accuse him of ""blackmail"" as it activated an emergency plan that could lead to rationing.

 Reflecting the gloomy mood as a result of supply disruptions and surging raw material costs, Japanese business confidence hit a nine-month low in the first quarter according to a Bank of Japan survey, with companies indicating they expect conditions to worsen further.

 In Tokyo, the Nikkei was down 0.75% in morning trade, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.70% lower.

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 1.1%, while Seoul's Kospi lost about 0.6%. Chinese blue-chips turned around from a lower open to rise 0.7%.

 MSCI's global share index, and U.S. and European shares all notched their biggest quarterly drops since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in the quarter that ended on March 31. Investors have been worried that surging price pressures could force global central banks into aggressive rate hikes, potentially triggering recessions.

 But the quarterly drop in U.S. shares masks a late comeback in the S&P500 index, which rallied from a near-13% decline to finish the quarter off about 5%, defying worries over tighter monetary policy and global instability, and in contrast to signals sent by bond markets.

 ""A seeming end to the Ukraine conflict would in many respects make it easier for the Fed to stick to its hawkish line given the rally in growth stocks, and related decline in credit spreads, means an improvement in financial conditions,"" said Christopher Wood, global and Asia equity strategist at Jefferies. 

 ""Political pressure remains, for now at least, on the Fed to tighten.""

 Investors will be watching U.S. March jobs data later on Friday for indications of wage inflation, in addition to the headline jobs figure.

 The closely watched spread between U.S. two-year and 10-year notes was barely above zero on Friday morning, after briefly inverting.

 An inversion in this part of the U.S. yield curve is viewed as a reliable signal that a recession may follow in one to two years. 

 Benchmark 10-year notes last yielded 2.3781%, from 2.325% late on Thursday while the 2-year yield was a 2.3648%, from 2.284%.

 In energy markets, oil prices stabilised following a plunge on Thursday triggered by Washington's announcement that it would make the largest-ever release from U.S. emergency oil reserves, part of a broad effort to rein in galloping inflation.

â€œWhile this deal is a long-term positive for L&T Infotech, the LTI stock has been in trouble in the last month. Therefore, we recommend investors be cautious and wait for the economic stabilization and recovery before taking new positions,â€ she said.

Upon the amalgamation scheme becoming effective, all shareholders of Mindtree will be issued shares of LTI at the ratio of 73 shares of LTI for every 100 shares of Mindtree.

The new shares of LTI so issued will be traded on the NSE and BSE. Larsen & Toubro Limited will hold 68.73 per cent of LTI after the merger.

Significant scale benefits are anticipated through LTI and Mindtreeâ€™s complementary strengths resulting in a stronger portfolio of offerings across verticals for the combined entity, which is to be called LTIMindtree.

The deal translates into various synergies between the two companies being unlocked as the pair have complementary client sets and can cross-sell and rationalize the cost of operations, Srivastava said, adding that large-cap IT stocks could see new competition for larger outsourcing contracts from this new entity.

Kasliwal of Choice Equities lists out a few key areas in which the merger between the two companies would benefit shareholders.

Firstly, he cited economies of scale and scope, saying that with the two entities currently boasting of combined revenue of $3.5 billion, the deal would aid the merged entity to realize synergies, gain almost all service abilities, and get catapulted into the league of the Big 5 of Indian IT- TCS, Infosys, HCL, Wipro and Tech Mahindra.

â€œHence, LTI-Mindtree can tap into larger market opportunities, drive down cost and minimise risk,â€ he said.

The analyst also pointed out sharing of complementary abilities and little in the way of competition as key benefits for shareholders, pointing out that since the two companies work in different verticals, the combination would help both leverage on each otherâ€™s strengths without duplication.

â€œLTI and Mindtree focus on largely different set of industries and clients where there is little overlap- LTI operates largely in BFSI whole Mindtree operates largely in Hi tech, media and retail- hence, we expect only limited employee churn,â€ he said.

â€œMindtreeâ€™s portfolio has strong capabilities and clientele in verticals that are complementary to LTI. Hence, the merger will allow the pair to deliver higher value to clients by providing them diversified end to end offerings.â€

The new entity is also seen having an improved financial position which would aid in in attracting more and better talent.

Choice Equities expects the merged entity to post revenue of Rs 34,700 crore by the end of the current financial year and a profit after tax of Rs 5,500 crore.

The revenue in the next financial year is seen at Rs 44,680 crore and net profit at Rs 7,500 crore.

â€œ...we believe that the benefits of cost synergies and operating leverage will play out very well, enhancing predicted topline as well as margin,â€ Kasliwal said. END

Investment RationalePhoenix Mills (PHNX) reported strong revenue/EBITDA/APAT at INR 4.9/2.4/1.05bn, beat at all levels. Retail consumption for the year was INR 46.8bn (excl. Palassio) and was 1.7x FY21 and 70% of FY20/FY19 level. Consumption has bounced back and, in Apr-22, it was 129% of pre-COVID level. The effect of inflation on consumption was not significant; however, price escalation is on the cards from many retailers, which will translate into higher revenue for PHNX. The convergence of leased and trading occupancy shall further push growth by ~8% as multiple tenants under fit-outs move to trading. PHNX acquired the remaining stake in PMC Chennai for INR 9.4bn at a cap rate of ~9%. Within office space, Fountainhead Tower 2 started contributing. Office income was up 22% YoY in FY22. Until now (in FY23), 0.1msf has been leased in this segment. Gross debt inched up INR 740mn sequentially, on account of debt drawn for Indore and Ahmedabad mall construction, which are expected to commence operations by Diwali 2022. The brokerage maintains BUY, with an unchanged SOTP of INR 1,364 on account of: (1) slightly better rental pricing; (2) 15% NAV premium on account of likely new mall addition (PML has huge growth headroom as balance sheet is under-leveraged and it may now shift gear from capital perseveration to growth); and (3) likely increase in new mall/office addition.

2022-04-12,PACL case: Sebi panel asks investors to submit original registration certificates for refund,"""The window for accepting original certificates shall remain open from April 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a press release.","New Delhi: A high-powered Sebi committee on Tuesday asked investors in illegal schemes of PACL to submit their original registration certificates till June 30 only after receiving an SMS from the panel. This is applicable only for those investors whose claim money is between Rs 10,001 and Rs 15,000 and whose applications have been verified. 

 ""The window for accepting original certificates shall remain open from April 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a press release. 

 The markets regulator had set up a committee headed by former Chief Justice of India R M Lodha following a Supreme Court order to refund money to investors in the matter of PACL Group. 

 The panel is overseeing the process of disposing of properties to refund investors after verifying their genuineness. It has already initiated the process of refund in phases. 

 PACL, also known as Pearl Group, which had raised money from the public in the name of agriculture and real estate businesses, was found by Sebi to have collected more than Rs 60,000 crore through illegal collective investment schemes (CIS) over a period of 18 years. 

 In the press release, the Lodha Committee said it has ""decided to call for original PACL registration certificate from eligible investors with claims between Rs 10,001 and Rs 15,000, whose applications have been successfully verified"". 

 To this end, an SMS will be sent to the eligible investors asking them to submit original registration certificates. 

 PACL investors who receive SMS from the committee requiring submission of original certificates issued to them by PACL, will have to forward the same by registered or speed post to Sebi's headquarter in Mumbai. 

 In December 2015, Sebi had ordered attachment of all assets of PACL and its nine promoters and directors for their failure to refund the money due to investors. 

 Sebi had asked PACL as also its promoters and directors to refund the money in an order passed in August 2014. Also, the defaulters were directed to wind up the schemes and refund money to the investors within three months from the date of the order.

2022-06-23,RBI stance on fintech has government backing,"Government officials told ET that the RBI order, published late Monday, came after commercial lenders had raised concerns with the banking regulator over likely rule breaches by fintech companies.","AFPRBI (File Photo)The Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s latest move barring non-bank prepaid payment issuers from loading credit lines onto their products has the support of the government, which also wants a comprehensive regulatory framework soon for the fintech sector that has lately seen several complaints of potential breaches in prudential norms.

Government officials told ET that the RBI order, published late Monday, came after commercial lenders had raised concerns with the banking regulator over likely rule breaches by fintech companies.


ETtech
â€œBanks had raised concerns with the RBI on possible breaches of anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines, and slackened Know Your Customer (KYC) norms by fintech companies,â€ an official aware of the matter told ET.


Safeguards concernsThe government too wants a more regulated framework for the fintech sector, said the official, adding that the RBI is in discussions with all stakeholders on the issue. A more comprehensive guideline is expected in the future, the official added.

Concerns that several new-age fintech companies seemingly assumed the role of lenders, without building adequate safeguards, may have prompted the banking regulator to impose curbs on fintech companies using prepaid instruments to channel credit, 
ET reported Wednesday. The payments industry, on the other hand, saw the order as the central bankâ€™s virtual endorsement that banks would be primary custodians of the sectorâ€™s innovation stack, potentially hurting their business case, ET reported.

On Monday, the RBI had issued a directive saying prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) canâ€™t be used to push credit.

â€œSuch practice, if followed, should be stopped immediately,â€ the central bank said in its order. â€œAny non-compliance in this regard may attract penal action under provisions contained in the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.â€

The Indian Banks' Association, or IBA, had told the central bank that the burden of KYC norms with regards to transactions involving fintech companies was falling on banks, ET reported earlier. The banking industry grouping had further pointed out that since the lenders did not have visibility of underlying transactions, they could also be in potential breach of anti-money laundering guidelines.


Underreporting loan exposures
Banks had further demanded a level playing field, adding that some of the loans offered by these firms were not reported to credit bureaus. This increased the risk for other lenders that relied on credit bureaus to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants.

In a recent report, the central bank had also observed that since fintech unbundled services across a wide number of domains, it is necessary to clearly demarcate responsibilities of various regulators over relevant aspects of the business entity. The report had also noted that the supply of funds for digital lenders could be more pro-cyclical and volatile due to the lack of standard credit guidelines.

â€œFurther, credit activity outside the prudential regulation space could render credit-related countercyclical policies less effective,â€ it added.

Meanwhile, some companies, including EarlySalary, have temporarily disabled future transactions to comply with the RBIâ€™s order, ET reported Wednesday, citing a company note.

On the other hand, Industry groupings such as the Digital Lendersâ€™ Association of India (DLAI) and the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) are seeking relief from the regulator, pushing for a deferment of implementation timelines.

 The company also said it will not apply to list its shares on any other stock exchange before the delisting of its American Depositary Shares from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was complete. 

 It added that it will continue to explore appropriate measures that include exploring a potential listing on another internationally recognized exchange, it said. 

 Didi announced in December that it would delist from the NYSE and pursue a listing in Hong Kong after it ran foul of Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO last year.

 Chinese regulators had urged the firm to put its listing on hold while a cybersecurity review of its data practices was conducted, sources have told Reuters. 

 Days after it went ahead, the country's powerful cyberspace watchdog ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi and told the company to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest.

 China's securities regulator, in a statement noting Didi's Saturday announcement, said the decision was one that the company had made independently and had nothing to do with other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks or ongoing efforts between Chinese regulators and their U.S. counterparts to resolve an audit dispute affecting U.S.-listed Chinese firms.

 Didi's total revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021 fell to 40.8 billion yuan ($6.40 billion) from 46.7 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said in a separate statement also issued on Saturday.

Investment Rationale Adani Wilmar (AWL) is a strong market leader (50:50 JV between Adani Group and Wilmar) in branded edible oil and industry essentials with aspirations to further scale-up packaged foods. Strong competitive advantages (price-laddering, oil segments, scale, market intelligence (courtesy Wilmar)) in edible oil provide AWL with an edge over competition. Further, AWL enjoys multiple synergies across all three business segments which augur well for scale up of packaged foods business â€“ a) scale in procurement & logistics, b) brand recall of â€˜Fortuneâ€™ and c) readily available distribution and mix-load supply chain benefit from edible oil.

The brokerage models revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 9%/24%/35% over FY22-24E. It initiates coverage on the stock with HOLD rating and SoTP-based TP of Rs 550. Key risks: 1) Higher volatility in raw material prices, 2) failure in scaling up packaged foods.

ETMarkets Smart Talk: Indiaâ€™s investable landscape wider than other EMs despite premium valuations: Piyush SharmaIt was the weekly options expiry, and it went well on the expected lines. The markets picked up steam the moment it was above 16,500. This level continued to see high put wiring activity during the day. Moving on from here, the Nifty is near the upper edge of the consolidation and any move above 16,700 will propel the markets higher.

So long as the Nifty is below 16700, it will stay in the broad 16,400-16,700 congestion zone and would trade with positive bias but will refrain from taking any sustainable directional bias. Friday is likely to see a stable start; the levels of 16,700 and 16,765 will act as immediate resistance points. The supports come in at 16,550 and 16,480 levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 53.31. It shows a mild bullish divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bullish and remains above the signal line. A bullish engulfing candle emerged on the charts; it may act as a potential onset of resumption of the up move for the index, subject to confirmation.

The pattern analysis shows that the Nifty got a breakaway gap above 16400. However, after that it consolidated in a narrow zone and saw a classical throwback. It tested the levels from where it had broken out and it has tried to resume to up move. It has resistance near 16700; any move above that will propel the markets higher.

All in all, the analysis remains on similar lines. If the markets have some mild profit taking or remain weak if weak global cues affect them, it is strongly recommended to refrain from creating fresh shorts. All dips, if any, must be used to make select purchases. While continuing to adopt a selective approach in the markets, profits too must be protected at higher levels unless the level of 16,700 is taken out comprehensively.

Investment RationaleThe managementâ€™s optimism on growth especially from the non-gold book picking up and aiding overall growth is positive. With the impact of COVID-19 now largely behind, the brokerage believes CUB has the levers in place to deliver RoA of 1.5%. Though expectations of lower treasury income impacting the non-interest income could be potential RoA dampeners, better fee income and higher-than-expected recoveries could partially offset its impact. Overall asset quality stress remains manageable and it does not foresee any major asset quality shocks. The restructuring and ECLGS book behaving well are added positives. It believes with the granular credit portfolio and strong underwriting, the bank will be able to contain the loss-given defaults (LGD). CUB has a niche quality franchise with a proven history of conservative lending, differentiating it from similar-sized peers. It maintains a positive outlook on the stock with a BUY rating and arrive at a target price of Rs 175/share (1.7x FY24 ABV).

This reluctance of the market to trade below the low, even after six days, does suggest that the market is not in a mood to trade lower immediately. ","Shutterstock.comThe Nifty50 on Friday saw a gap-up start but could not add much to gains. The index ended up forming a small bullish candle on the daily chart. It ended up forming a 'Harami' candle on the weekly chart.

The weekly pattern is a bullish reversal pattern and one can assume that Nifty50 will see some upsides in the days to come, said Independent Analyst Manish Shah.

""On the daily time frame, Nifty50 has not made a new low since June 16. This reluctance of the market to trade below the low, even after six days, does suggest that the market is not in a mood to trade lower immediately. The Nifty50 needs to break above 15,850 to signal a rally to 16,200-16,300. Support in Nifty is at 15,400. A break below the support and there could be a further drop to 15,100-15,000.

For the day, the index closed at 15,699.25, up 142.60 points or 0.92 per cent.
Milan Vaishnav, Founder & Technical Analyst at Gemstone Equity Research, said that the level of 15,700 will act as an inflection point for the Nifty50. If the index stays below this point, then it might well consolidate in a defined range again. However, there are greater possibilities of it moving past 15,700 and inch higher towards 16,000 levels.

Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said the short-term trend of the Nifty50 continues to be positive.

""Having placed at the significant overhead resistance at 15,800 level, there is a possibility of one more leg of small downward correction from the highs of around 15,800-15,900 levels by next week, before showing any decisive upside breakout,"" he said.

Head and shoulders is one of the many popular chart patterns widely used by investors and traders to determine market trend. This pattern occurs on the chart when the stock/index price hits its peak and declines thereafter. Also Read

The stock broke below the neckline of the pattern earlier in June 2022 but stock price action seen in the last few sessions pushed the price above Rs 800 after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 763 on 23 June 2022.

But chart structure still remains weak and the short-term traders can look for shorting opportunities in the stock for a target of Rs 650 on the downside, suggest experts.

On the price front, the stock is trading below 20, 30, 50, 100 and 200 DMA but above 5 and 10-DMA.

MACD is below its signal and center line, this is a strong bearish indicator. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.4. RSI below 30 is considered oversold and above 70 is considered overbought, Trendlyne data showed.

From higher time frame to lower time frame, IndusInd Bankâ€™s stock chart structure harps on the same string and tilts towards negative development.

â€œStock is reacting from the quarterly chart resistance band and its ripple effect can be seen on the lower time frame chart. On the weekly chart, stocks have formed a Head & Shoulder pattern for the duration of 82 weeks,â€ Kapil Shah, Technical Analyst, Emkay Global Financial Services Limited and Trainer at FinLearn Academy, said.

â€œPatterns that take a larger time to form are considered to be more powerful. In an ongoing week, Stock has breached the neckline or support line which confirms the negative implication of the pattern,â€ he added.

From the Oscillator perspective, MACD has given a negative crossover in the negative zone which is a bearish continuation sign. 

Based on the above rationale, the stock offers a short opportunity in the zone of Rs 787 to Rs 800 with stop loss at Rs 835 level on a closing basis, recommends Shah.

â€œOn the downside, Stock has immediate support at the Rs 650 level. With this setup, stock offers a risk-reward ratio of 1:3 and the duration of this view can be around 1 to 2 months,â€ he added.

2022-06-29,Auto stocks that analysts prefer ahead of June sales data,"Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) due to strong model cycle tailwinds. It also likes Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Rising electrification and content per vehicle will be the key value drivers for suppliers, the brokerage added, as it prefers Sona Comstar, Minda Industries and Sansera in the ancillary space.","AgenciesAnalysts estimates show Tata Motors CV business is likely to show 11-27 per cent year-on-year (YoY) sales growth, the most among its competitors.Commercial vehicle (CV) sales may stay on the uptrend while some improvement in sales is likely in the personal vehicle (PV) segment, analysts said ahead of June sales data. Two-wheelers numbers may be weak on a month-on-month (MoM) basis post-marriage season demand in May, they said. Tractors sales may improve MoM but would be weak YoY due to delayed monsoon, analysts added. 

Motilal Oswal said it prefers companies with higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, margin drivers, and balance sheet strength. Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland are its top auto picks. It also likes Tata Motors as a play on the global PV cycle. In the ancillary space, it prefers Bharat Forge and Apollo Tyres.

Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) due to strong model cycle tailwinds. It also likes Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Rising electrification and content per vehicle will be the key value drivers for suppliers, the brokerage added, as it prefers Sona Comstar, Minda Industries and Sansera in the ancillary space.

Emkay likes Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Escorts in the auto space and Motherson Sumi and Minda Industries in the ancillary space.

Choice Broking, meanwhile, has an 'Outperform' rating on Ashok Leyland and an 'Add' rating on a handful of stocks such as M&M, Maruti, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor.
Channel checks, said Choice Broking, suggests sales momentum for PV, CV, and tractor segments may continue to be healthy YoY despite the industry entering into the off-season cycle i.e. July-August. The brokerage expects two-wheeler sales to be weak due to higher vehicle and fuel costs, cooling-off of marriage-related purchases, and weak sentiment in the lower-income bracket.

Nomura India said healthy demand trends sustained for both medium-heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) and PV in June, as it expects PV wholesales to benefit from improving chip supplies, with June volumes likely at 3,17,000 units, being the â€˜all-time best Juneâ€™ wholesales. The brokerage expects a further improvement in July.
For two-wheelers, retail sales have dropped 8-10 per cent MoM post-marriage season demand in May, Nomura said, as it estimates industry retails in June to be below the June 15 levels.

""While easing semiconductor supplies boost PV retail figures, CV demand momentum is sustaining. We prefer 4Ws over 2Ws underpinned by strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We expect the CV cycle to maintain its momentum,"" Motilal said.

Motilal said a delayed monsoon has led to the postponement of demand for tractors. Agricultural demand is subdued currently, and commercial demand remains flat. Inventory in the system is around 30 days, it said. On a year-on-year basis, this brokerage expects tractor volumes to decline 3 per cent for M&M and 2 per cent for Escorts.

On a MoM basis, however, Emkay sees tractor volumes improving MoM, with the growth of 11 per cent for Escorts and 10 per cent for M&M in the domestic market. Growth has been restricted as farmer sentiments have been hit by lower crop realisations in recent months, Emkay noted.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its biggest daily percentage drop in about a month, with declines in heavyweight stocks such as Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc .

At a conference on Tuesday, Brainard said she expects methodical interest rate increases and rapid reductions to the Fed's balance sheet to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year, with further tightening to follow as needed.

Brainard's comments ""drove home the point that the Fed is poised to get more aggressive,â€ said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.

â€œThat is certainly having a negative effect on equities because of concerns that this increases the probability of a recession,"" Hooper said. ""Itâ€™s going to be increasingly difficult for the Fed to engineer a soft landing the more aggressive it gets.â€

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 280.7 points, or 0.8%, to 34,641.18, the S&P 500 lost 57.52 points, or 1.26%, to 4,525.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 328.39 points, or 2.26%, to 14,204.17.

Among S&P 500 sectors, technology slumped 2.2% while consumer discretionary fell 2.4%. The utilities sector rose 0.7%.

U.S. Treasury yields rose to multi-year highs with yields taking off after Brainard's comments.

The prospect of a more hawkish Fed led to a rocky start to the year for equities and in particular for tech and growth shares whose valuations stand to be more pressured by higher bond yields. Stocks have rebounded in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 now down about 5% so far this year.

Focus on the Fed will continue on Wednesday, when the central bank releases minutes of its March meeting.

â€œFor the rest of this week, the market will be driven by interest rates and it will be driven by the Fedâ€™s comments about interest rates,â€ said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Investors also remain focused on the Ukraine crisis, which has led to rising commodity prices that stand to worsen an already-worrisome inflationary picture.

In economic news, data showed U.S. services industry activity picked up in March, boosted by the rolling back of pandemic restrictions, but businesses continued to face higher costs as supply strains persisted.

In company news, shares of Twitter Inc gained 2%, adding to their prior-day surge, as the social media company said it will offer Tesla CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk a seat on its board of directors.

Carnival Corp shares rose 2.4% after the cruise operator reported its highest booking week in its history.

Shares of Spirit Airlines soared 22.5% after reports that JetBlue Airways has made an offer to buy Spirit.

Some are bullish for the long term while others believe the issue is expensive at the given price.

The IPO of the logistic company with a tech-based model was launched on Wednesday at a price band of Rs 462-487 per share. It has cut its offer size to Rs 5,235 crore from Rs 7,460 crore as planned earlier. In the IPO, Delhivery will issue fresh equity shares worth Rs 4,000 crore.

The company has reported good revenue growth of 82 per cent in 9MFY22 and it is expected that it may turn EBITDA positive by FY22-end. ""Given the expensive valuation, we are assigning a neutral recommendation to Delhivery IPO,â€ Gupta said.

In the coming session as well, we will continue to see pockets like PSE stocks, FMCG, Consumption, IT, and Pharma doing relatively well than the rest of the population.","On a weekly options expiry day, the Indian equities had a strong trending day as they opened strong, got better as the day progressed and ended the day on a strong note. The Nifty saw itself opening comfortably above the crucial 200-DMA. It maintained its gains in the morning session. As the day progressed, the markets got even stronger. 

The index, in the process, kept marking gradual incremental highs and managed to close near the high point of the day. There was no sign of profit-taking at any point in time. The headline index closed with a net gain of 256.05 points (+1.49%).

ETMarkets.com
The weekly options expiry took place today. In the previous note, it was mentioned that the level of 17,200 had the second-highest call OI accumulation. Since the markets opened well above that, they trended strongly towards the 17,400 levels. 

The highest call writing was witnessed at this point and prevented the Nifty to stay a notch below this level. Importantly, the index has managed to hold on to the 200-DMA as its crucial support on a closing basis. The 200-DMA stays at 17,185. The monthly options expiry data shows that the upsides may get capped near 17,500, which holds the maximum Call OI accumulation as of now.

 However, this is very indicative -- if the up move gets extended, then the price action of Nifty against the level of 17,500 will be crucial to watch.

Friday is likely to see a quiet start to the day. The levels of 17,440 and 17,500 will act as probable resistance points. The supports come in at 17,280 and 17,185 levels.

The daily RSI is 5,135; it stays neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The daily MACD is bearish and stays below the signal line. A rising window emerged on the candle -- this usually resolves in the direction of the trend. The pattern analysis shows that after a brief violation of the 200-DMA, the Nifty managed to crawl back above this point. 

The 200-DMA stands at 17,185 and is likely to remain a crucial support point for the index in the near term on a closing basis.

All in all, the defensive play in the markets was evident. In the coming session as well, we will continue to see pockets like PSE stocks, FMCG, Consumption, IT, and Pharma doing relatively well than the rest of the population. 

We recommend continuing to stay selective and keep leveraged exposures on a modest level. Until and unless the levels of 17,500 are not taken out comprehensively, vigilant protection of profits is advised.

Here's what Viral Chheda, Technical Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

HPCL: Sell on RallyAfter making a 3-year high of Rs 354.8 in November 2021, the price has given a sharp selloff to trade around Rs 215 odd level. The stock has made a Lower Top Lower Bottom Pattern during this period.

MORE STORIES FOR YOUâœ•Adani Enterprises shares jump 3% as TotalEnergies to pick stake in armAhead of Market: 10 things that will decide D-St action on WednesdayAhead of Market: 12 things that will decide D-Street action on TuesdayÂ« Back to recommendation storiesI don't want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMITFrom February 2021 to till date, we have seen the price to make a Head and Shoulder Pattern with neckline stand at Rs 225 odd levels.

In the current week, the price has breached the pattern with high volume on the lower side and from here we can see further downside till Rs 200-180 odd levels.

More selling pressure can be witnessed at this level and hence we would recommend selling the stock on every rise at every higher level.

A close above the Rs 255 level could add some stability to the stock and then we could see some upside. But, the bias is in favour of more downside.

We recommend investors avoid buying at this level and sell on rise around Rs 235-240 odd level for a downside target of Rs 200 - 180 in the next 3-4 months.


Adani Enterprises: BuyFrom lows of Rs 121 in March 2020, the stock has given a sharp upside rally to make an all-time high of Rs 1,908 in January 2022. Volumes were quite high during this period.

From a high of Rs 1,908, the price corrected to take support at 50-WMA at Rs 1,525 and gave a sharp upside rally to make a new all-time high of Rs 2,421-odd level.

Currently, after moving in the range of mere 300 points for the past 2 months, with relatively higher volume, the price has now breached the range on the higher side and from here we can see the stock making a new high.

Price is also moving above major averages which is a good sign for a bull run.

Hence, we recommend investors to buy at this level and more on dips towards Rs 1,900 with a stop loss of Rs 1,700 on a closing basis. On the upside, we can see levels of Rs 2,600-3,000 odd levels in the next 8-10 months.


Adani Wilmar: BuyAt the time of listing, the stock opened below the offer price to make a low of Rs 227 and from there we saw a sharp upside rally of 190 points in that particular week.

From 12 Feb 2022 to 25 Mar 2022, the price moved in a consolidation phase and once it breached the range on the higher side, the price gave an upward move to make an all-time high of Rs 878-odd levels.

From a high of Rs 878, the price retraced almost 52% of the previous rally to make a low around Rs 540 and currently, it is moving at Rs 615-odd level.

We can see further upside till Rs 850-1000 levels. At the current level, we can see positive divergence and once it goes above 50-DMA of Rs 660, a sharp upward move can be seen.

Hence, we recommend buying at this level and more at dips of Rs 540 with a stop loss of Rs 470 on a closing basis for a target of Rs 900-1,100 in the next 6-8 months.

2022-06-20,China's stock rally is now a lifeline for Asian portfolios,"It's ""very likely that China stocks will help Asia outperform given that China's stimulus effect will be more pronounced in the second half,"" said Kerry Goh, chief investment officer at Kamet Capital. ""Economically, Asia is more dependent on China than the rest of the world.""","PTIChinese stocks' outstanding resilience in a global selloff is giving Asia investors hopes that regional equities will get a lift in the second half.

In a brutal month that's seen the world's major stock indexes tumble into bear markets, Chinese shares have jumped. Their high weighting has helped put the Asian benchmark on track to beat a global gauge by the most since October 2020 this month. 

China's all-out efforts to revive the economy - in contrast to aggressive monetary tightening in the US and elsewhere - is also supporting the earnings outlook for the region.

It's ""very likely that China stocks will help Asia outperform given that China's stimulus effect will be more pronounced in the second half,"" said Kerry Goh, chief investment officer at Kamet Capital. ""Economically, Asia is more dependent on China than the rest of the world.""

Equities in China and Hong Kong account for about a quarter of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which has outperformed an index of global stocks by almost five percentage points over the past month. China's CSI 300 Index has jumped 7.6% in the period, rebounding from sharp losses earlier this year.

Driving gains in China are loose monetary policy, a partial lifting of virus curbs and bets that the era of tech crackdowns is over. Even with Covid headwinds, a majority of analysts still expect China's economy to grow more than 4% this year, versus 2.6% for the US, which will offer tailwinds to Asia where most countries list China as their largest trade partner. 

The US is at the epicenter of monetary tightening but China, Asia's largest market, ""is in a different point in its cycle and is currently easing policy,"" strategists including Tim Moe wrote in a note earlier this month.

It suggests investors to find stocks with higher Relative Strength Ratings. â€œYou would also want your stocks to hail from leading groups, so insist on a solid Group Rank. Fundamental strength should also play a vital role. Remember, you're looking for the very best the market has to offer. That means finding stocks with good quarterly sales and profit growth. EPS Rank will help you here,â€ it said.

Their analysis shows that the RS Ratings of leading bank stocks with high weightage in Nifty have improved in the last five weeks, which is a positive indication. The RS Ratings of IT stocks also improved last week.

According to the report, these sectors can be the potential market leaders if Nifty rallies from here.

On the other hand, RS Ratings of metal stocks, which have been under pressure due to falling commodity prices, are very poor and show no signs of improvement.

â€œRS Ratings of Tata Steel, Hindalco, and JSW Steel dropped to 15â€“30, indicating that the damage is deep and might need time to repair,â€ the report said. Similarly, RS Ratings of Realty stocks also deteriorated notably, while that of pharma stocks remained relatively unchanged.

â€œWithout trying to predict and decode stories, we will take what the market gives and continue to monitor the unfolding conditions. Stocks that are breaking out of their bases, with higher relative strength and superior fundamentals, can do well,â€ William O'Neil India said.

In the last one month period, both Nifty and Nifty IT have fallen by 2.64 per cent while Nifty Bank is down by 1.93 per cent. Metal stocks have been the biggest wealth eroders as the metal index is down 11.27 per cent in a month. The pharma index, on the other hand, has lost 4 per cent of its value.

Vi shares were up 3.3% at Rs 9.03 on BSE in early trade today. The telcoâ€™s quarterly revenue increased 5.4% sequentially to Rs 10,239.5 crore in the January-March quarter, while ARPU rose to Rs 124 from Rs 115 in the previous quarter.

On Tuesday, Vi said that the telecom department had computed the net present value (NPV) of the accrued interest due to the four-year deferral of the spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) payments at Rs 16,133.1 crore, a calculation since confirmed by the telco.

An analyst at a leading global brokerage said the NPV would likely lead to a government stake in Vi at around 32%, given that promoter Vodafone Group UK had recently increased its stake in the carrier to 47.61% after Rs 4,500 crore promoter-level infusions. Upon the NPV conversion, the government will become the single largest shareholder in the telco.

But many analysts have maintained their price targets on the Tata group stock, calling the subdued quarterly sales a one-off event.

Kotak Institutional Equities was expecting a 15-16 per cent growth in jewellery segment sales. ""It implies deceleration in 3-year CAGR to 15 per cent in Q4 from 22 per cent in Q3. We expect demand recovery as gold price stabilises, though there is a 2-3 per cent downside risk to our FY23-FY24 jewellery sales and a 4-5 per cent risk to our FY23-24 earnings estimates. We view Q4 as a blip in a promising story,"" it said.

Titan Company said jewellery segment sales for the quarter were partly hit by a surge in gold prices in March, as they were up 10 per cent early in the month. Omicron also impacted demand in January even as business bounced back in February. Titan said the jewellery business in top 8 cities grew in single digits whereas the rest of India saw a decline.

While the performance is below trend, Edelweiss said the underlying structural growth stays unchanged. It believes that any correction in the stock will be an opportunity to buy. This brokerage has maintained its target EV/Ebitda at 65 times with an unchanged target of Rs 3,065 on the stock.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his better half Rekha held a 5.09 per cent stake in Titan Company as of December 31, which amounted to Rs 11,483 crore as of Wednesday's stock price.

During the quarter, plain gold jewellery sales declined marginally while studded sales grew in high single digits. ""It augurs well for margin in view of inventory gains (diamond prices up 20 per cent in 4Q). Yet, we expect jewellery EBIT margin to be 40 bps below the estimate of 13.6 per cent, given lower than expected operating leverage,"" Kotak Securities.

Net store expansion, the company said, continued as per plan with the commissioning of 7 new stores in Tanishq, 8 in Mia by Tanishq and 1 in Zaya.

Amnish Aggarwal, Director-Research at Prabhudas Lilladher said his channel check suggests that industry sales were down by 50-60 per cent sequentially and Tanishq has gained share given structural tailwinds. Diamond prices, he said, jumped by 40 per cent in the past few months and the brokerage expects diamond prices to remain firm given no Russian will be available.

""We expect jewellery business to sustain strong margins due to inventory gains in diamonds in Q4 and Q123 as well,"" he said.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services said gold prices stabilised at lower levels by the end of the quarter, wedding demand remains very healthy and there is less likelihood of disruption by any further Covid-wave.

""There could be some residual impact in Q1FY23E as well. But the structural investment case for Titan remains intact. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of Rs 2,910 premised on 75 times March 2024 EPS,"" it said.

Prabhudas Lilladher's Aggarwal said Titan is well placed to capitalise on long-term growth led by the benefit of hallmarking, omni-channel strategy across jewellery, watches and eyewear and new growth drivers like Caratlane, Titan Eye+, Taneira.

 Technical Indicators
 The MACD signalled a bearish bias on the counter. The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ""buy"" or ""sell"" opportunities. When the MACD crosses below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see a downward movement and vice versa.

""Moreover, with Thursday's move, the index also closed above the 200-day simple moving average (17,185), giving a psychological advantage to the bulls. However, the index needs to completely bridge the bearish gap with a close above 17,457 levels. In that scenario, eventually, the strength shall expand towards 17,856 levels,"" Mohammad said.

For the day, the index was at 17,392.60, up 256.05 points or 1.49 per cent.

Sameet Chavan of Angel One said that a close near the highest point of the day augurs well for the bulls.
""For the coming session, 17,450 is the immediate level to watch out for and the moment we surpass this, the index would continue its march towards 17,600 â€“ 17,700. On the flipside, 17,300 followed by 17,200 are likely to provide an immediate cushion. Traders are advised to use declines to buy into and should continue to focus on thematic moves.

Independent analyst Manish Shah said that the index was trading in a band of 16,800-18,100 for the last several months, adding that a bullish pattern at the support does deliver more credence to the underlying price structure.

""For the day, the market saw a gap up; a rising window and that is formed is a Bullish Island reversal. The index seems to be poised to hit the top end of the range at 18,100. Whether or not Nifty50 will manage to break above the range remains to be seen. Going into the last week of April's expiry, we expect the market to show a bullish undertone. Support for Nifty50 is at 17,210 and we cannot allow the index to break below this level if the rally has to continue,"" Shah said.
Mohammad also said that the index needs to sustain above the 17,215 level to retain positive bias.

For time being it looks prudent to 'buy the dip' with a stop below the 17,200 level, he said.

    	                NSEBSEBoston Education and Software Technologies Ltd.PEER COMPANIESExplore NowFamous investor and author Richard Koch says investors should select an investment approach that they like the most and that is suited to their personality and skills, and stick consistently to it for all their stock market investments.

""There are many routes to success and any one of them can work if it suits you. The road to hell, in contrast, is well sign-posted and well travelled. The ways to win are many and unpredictable, but the ways to lose are fewer and entirely predictable. Whichever ladder you climb, you will need to steer clear of the same snakes,"" he wrote in his book 
Selecting shares that perform.

Richard Koch is a former management consultant, entrepreneur, and a renowned author. Koch has also used his investment strategy to make a fortune from several private equity investments made personally. Previously, he had been a manager at Boston Consulting Group and later a partner at Bain and Company, before leaving to start management consulting firm LEK Consulting with Jim Lawrence and Iain Evans. 

He was educated at the universities of Pennsylvania and Oxford. Koch is the author of more than 20 books, including the bestsellers 
The 80/20 Principle and 
The Financial Times Guide to Selecting shares that perform. He is also a successful investor and entrepreneur, with ventures including Filofax, Belgo, Plymouth Gin and Betfair. 


Rules to stop losing the investment battleWith his years of experience in the investment industry Koch wrote certain guidelines in his book to help avoid the unnecessary mistakes made by investors. Let's take a look at some of these investment guidelines.


Never invest funds you donâ€™t ownKoch says even if investors are able to, they should not borrow money to make equity investments.

""However wealthy you are, donâ€™t do it. It has ruined millionaires and billionaires. Donâ€™t let it ruin you. The only thing to invest is money that you own which is not needed for any other purpose. There must be no exceptions to this rule,"" he says.


Choose short-term investments with great cautionKoch says if investors decide to invest for a relatively short period which means two years or less there should be a valid reason for doing so.

""The reason you have this time horizon is because you then want to use the money for something else: school fees, going round the world, a house deposit, or whatever. It would be annoying not to have your starting capital when that time comes,"" he says.

Koch says the long-term record of shares is excellent but there is always a risk of a big fall over a short period and there is little protection in picking the most large, stable and â€˜safeâ€™ share, because if there is a general market decline, then blue chips will fall in line with the market.

""On the whole, the stock market is not a good place for short-term, â€˜hotâ€™ money,"" he says.


Do not over-diversify your portfolioKoch says investors should not over diversify their portfolio and never hold too many stocks as holding more than about 15 stocks does little to decrease risk.

According to Koch, investors should know the companies they invest in extraordinarily well, which is very difficult if they invest in a large number of companies. 

""It is better to know a few things rather well, or one thing very well, than it is to know something about a lot of things,"" he says.

Koch says another reason for investing in fewer stocks is that inevitably investors will pause longer, think harder and weigh the buy or sell decision more carefully.

""You will also be more vigilant in keeping an eye on them and will stand a much less chance of missing any necessity to sell, lighten or increase your holding. But how many is too many? It depends partly, but only partly, on the amount of time you have for your investments,"" he says.


Only invest if you are confidentKoch says before investing it is best to be confident about the medium and long-term prospects for the company.

""You should not invest because you consider the shares â€˜a strong betâ€™. You must first look at the company and assess, by numbers or otherwise, whether it has a good future of growth ahead of it (one good way to assess this is to look at its past). Then you must consider whether the shares are fairly priced, undervalued or overvalued. One of the advantages of having a small portfolio of five to ten stocks is that you will not be tempted to include a few â€˜speculative long shotsâ€™,"" he says.


Never buy on tipsKoch says investors are probably approached from time to time by friends or acquaintances offering them â€˜hot tipsâ€™ based on rumours, or information close to the â€˜insideâ€™ but they should never, ever, buy shares as a result.

""For one thing, it just may be inside information, in which case you and your informant may be committing a criminal offence. But even if the use of insider information was made compulsory it is just not a sensible thing to do. You canâ€™t check the veracity or the importance of the data. In some cases, there may be a deliberate attempt to â€˜rampâ€™ the shares by those who have already bought and plan to sell soon. Tips belong on the race course, and even there they are usually wrong. Avoid them!,"" he says.


Do not follow the crowdKoch says investors should resist the lure of going with a fad as investors could probably beat the majority of investors only by following a different path.

""Stick to your investment strategy for the period you have set and do not be put off by analysts or be seduced by recommendations. You must still convince yourself, of course, that you are right, but, unless you have important new information since you made your original decision, do not be moved,"" he says.


Never â€˜average downâ€™ when the price is fallingKoch says averaging down is an unsound principle which means adding to holding of a stock, investors already have at a lower price than they previously paid for it, to lower the average acquisition price.

""The price at which you first bought a stock is irrelevant to whether you should buy or sell now. The only issue is whether, with the information you now have, the company has a good future and the shares are undervalued. Only this should impel you to buy, or indeed to hold, a stock: if you cannot confidently say â€˜yesâ€™ to the two points above, then sell,"" he says.

Koch has the following advice for investors if they are planning to average down -

1. Only average down with extreme caution, and after much deliberation.

2. Do not do it more than once a year.

3. Only do it if you are sure the companyâ€™s future is good and the shares are undervalued.

4. Do not allow one stock to take up more than a quarter of the value of your portfolio (this is an absolute maximum, not a target).

5. Never average down more than once for the same stock.

6. Never average down until the price has been stable or rising, with at least one dayâ€™s rise, for the previous three days.


Never be afraid to sell at a lossKoch says some experts believe that investors should always discard the loss makers once they have fallen a predetermined amount.

""If a share has fallen relative to the market as a whole (an important qualification), the onus is on you to say why you should keep it. You must have a good reason for doing so,"" he says.


Learn from your experienceKoch says investors personal experience of investment, if analysed carefully, probably will show recurrent patterns of behaviour. 

""If you divide your historic portfolio â€“ that is, all the shares you have owned â€“ into three categories, organised by the success or otherwise of the investments, itâ€™s likely that you will gain a lot of insight by asking what is common about all or some of the investments in each category. The aim is for you to categorise your investments as winners, losers and average (in all cases relative to the market), then to look at the winners and find a few common themes about them, either in terms of the types of company, how closely you know them, why you bought them, or any other common factors. Then repeat the process for the other two categories,"" he says. 


Do not invest heavily when everyone else is doing the sameKoch says investors should not commit a lot of funds to the market when it is reasonably possible that the market is hitting a cyclical high.

According to Koch, one way to avoid this is never to invest when the market is within 3 percent of a record high.


Balance patience and prudenceKoch says there are two opposite schools of thought and approaches that investors can undertake while making an investment decision.

According to Koch one is the â€˜long-termistâ€™ approach which holds that there are almost no circumstances in which investors should sell shares in a â€˜goodâ€™ company. 

According to this approach, the trick is to find a few such companies for the long term as an investor and then just stick with them. 

Koch says the opposite philosophy is that markets are volatile and no one ever went broke by taking a profit. 

""Which you prefer depends on how skilled you are likely to be at identifying even a few good companies. Not many people are good at doing this although, with the right training and encouragement to keep their eyes open, many more could be,"" he says.

Koch says the best general position, though, may be three-quarters towards the â€˜long termâ€™ view.

Koch lists some guidelines that may help investors make better investment decisions -

1. Do not be too patient with your under-performers.

2. Decide in advance if you have a target selling price above your cost price.

3. Even if the share reaches the target price, continue to hold (nervously) until the shares run out of steam.

4. If you can afford to, do not set a target price and continue to hold your winners for a very long time.

5. If your shares double in value in a short time, and you are thinking of selling, sell only half (or, if you have to, three-quarters) and lock the rest away.

According to Koch, beating the market is both possible and fun.

""If you fail: cut your losses. Hand your money management over to others and enjoy the rest of life. If you succeed, do something worthwhile with at least some of your wealth,"" he says.

2022-05-24,A silver lining for FMCG firms in H2 amid rising inflation,"Electronics makers, however, said there are no signs of inflation ebbing in their segment, and demand for entry-level products will remain under pressure over next few quarters.","representative imageConsumer product companies expect a recovery in demand and profitability during the second half of the financial year due to good monsoon, elevated farm prices, fading inflationary pressures in the coming months, and the 'low base' effect, even as they face slowing demand in the current quarter. Electronics makers, however, said there are no signs of inflation ebbing in their segment, and demand for entry-level products will remain under pressure over next few quarters.

""Given the forecast for a normal monsoon this year coupled with a good harvest and farmers getting better prices for their crop, I am hopeful of a faster rural recovery. While there is an immediate pressure, we expect rural demand to recover by end-June this year,"" said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer at Dabur India.

During the Jan-March quarter earnings performance, most companies blamed slowdown in the rural market for dragging the overall growth. However, expectations of a normal monsoon and elevated food prices have brightened the outlook for rural income in rabi and kharif season for FY23. In addition, non-agri wage growth has started to improve, up 4.2% in the second half of last fiscal after declining 0.5% in early FY22.

Volume, or unit sales, of daily consumer products people bought fell 4.1% year on year during the March quarter.


Decline Sharper in Rural Areas 
 During the quarter, shoppers cut back on household spending due to inflation and the Omicron wave dented sales, industry officials said, quoting Nielsen data. This was the second consecutive quarterly decline in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market after a 2.6% volume decline in the December quarter. The decline was sharper in rural areas that saw volume growth shrink by 5.3% during the March quarter while urban markets fell by 3.2%.




Marico Ltd managing director Saugata Gupta said FMCG market growth constituted a challenge in the near term due to high inflation and high base, but demand and volume growth should improve towards the end of the September quarter. ""This would be driven by the significant steps the government is taking to control inflation and lower base of the previous year. Even rural demand should improve in the next four to five months with projections of a normal monsoon and stability in inflation,"" said Gupta.

The government took a series of measures in order to cool inflationary pressures including reduced central excise duty on fuel, provide subsidy on gas cylinders and increased fertiliser subsidy. ""These interventions are likely to reduce inflation directly by 25 basis points, while indirect benefit can be another 25 bps. We expect inflation to average at 6-6.3% in FY23,"" said a recent report by Antique Broking. The lifting of a ban on palm oil export by Indonesia from Monday will aid margins too, which in turn, could slow down price increases that the companies have been making since several months.

 Emami Ltd vice chairman Mohan Goenka said while overall FMCG demand has been subdued, the summer products portfolio has registered double-digit growth for the first time in three years. ""Inflation is impacting the recovery, but we expect a recovery within the next two quarters. The government has already taken steps to control inflation and markets are wide open. If more stimulus is given by the government and there is normal monsoon, the recovery could be even earlier, including rural markets,"" he said.

Companies, however, said a bulk of their growth could still be driven by price increases and not by greater unit sales, especially in discretionary categories. ""Consumers are getting impacted by inflation in almost everything they buy and consume. This will lead to conservation in the form of controlled consumption or downtrading in the next two quarters.

Godrej Consumer Products said it anticipates a double-digit top line growth with low-single digit volume growth. ""Bottom line is hard to predict, but if the cost moderated to Malaysian ringgit 6,000 for palm oil, about 7% to 8% lower than where they are today and $100 for crude, we should see some margin expansion especially in the second half of the year,"" Sudhir Sitapati, managing director at Godrej Consumer Products, said during its earnings investor call.


Consumer Electronics

The consumer electronics industry had forecast a recovery of mass segment products and a revival in rural markets in the second half of this fiscal, but price increases of raw materials and consequentially final products will delay the recovery, industry executives said. Around 50-55% of the input cost are imported hence the industry expects prices will continue to go up by 5-6% every quarter. Prices have gone up by 10-12% already including the latest increase this month.

""Consumers of entry-level products are withholding discretionary purchases and buying electronic products only when there is a necessity. So the boom in AC and refrigerator purchases due to the heat wave may die down due to product price increases and overall inflationary environment,"" said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi.

2022-04-26,These stocks are slated to suffer due to rising palm oil prices,"The rising inflation has been a major problem for FMCG, consumer and QSR sectors, which have been hiking the prices to absorb the impact. But another price hike might be a major challenge for the companies.","Shutterstock.comPalm oil is the world's most widely used vegetable oil as it accounts for about 40 per cent of the supply of top four edible oils. New Delhi: The ban on export of palm oil from Indonesia will hit India the hardest, which is the largest import of vegetable oils in the world. Even a number of stocks will feel the heat in vegetable oil prices.

The rising inflation has been a major problem for FMCG, consumer and QSR sectors, which have been hiking the prices to absorb the impact. But another price hike might be a major challenge for the companies.

Palm oil is the world's most widely used vegetable oil as it accounts for about 40 per cent of the supply of top four edible oils. Global palm oil production slumped in 2020 and 2021 due to a drop in migrant labour on plantations across Southeast Asia.

""Palm oil is the relatively cheaper oil amongst the other edible oils. This move is expected to cause a further price increase in other edible oils such as soybean oil, sunflower oil,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in its report.

Market experts believe that shortage of edible oils will impact the FMCG segments like biscuits, cake, soaps, and shampoos where it is a significant input. The FMCG industry may experience margin compression due to the price hike.

VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that HUL, Godrej Consumer, ITC and Britannia are likely to be impacted by the rising costs of inputs.

The companies might be able to pass on the major part of higher cost to the consumers, but full burden shift may dent the volumes, he added. ""The FMCG sector is already struggling due to rising cost of packaging, thanks to the boil in crude oil.""

Being the biggest importer, India is highly dependent on Asian nations like Indonesia and Malaysia to fulfil its demand of 8 million tonnes of palm oil per year.

The Ukraine war has led to a large supply deficit of cooking oil across the globe, leading to prices of palm and soy oils to record highs. The export ban and increase in Malaysian taxes will further exacerbate the problem.

Echoing the similar views, Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said that this turmoil will negatively affect FMCG companies like HUL, Nestle, Britannia, Godrej Consumer Products, Marico among others.

""The high prices will leave packaged food products manufacturers, soap manufacturers, and other personal care manufacturers with no other option than to raise prices and thus affecting their volumes,"" he added.

Taking a step ahead, Prabhudas Lilladher said that palm oil is a key ingredient in the major food processing industry and QSRs, impacting their cost and margins.

We believe the impact would be seen most in categories such as biscuits, noodles, cakes, potato chips, frozen desserts,"" it added. ""QSRs like Westlife Development and Burger King can also feel the pinch given edible oil usage to cook/fry their patties/fries.""

The financial firm has a buy rating on the QSR firms like Westlife Development and Restaurant Brands Asia. It has suggested to accumulate Jubilant FoodWorks at the current levels.

""This new ban would likely keep prices firm to bullish in the near term until such a time the ban gets reversed and global commodity prices become stable,"" said the financial firm in its report.

 ""We're moving back to being a more lean company with a leaner operating model, starting with the reduction in force that we announced earlier this week,"" said Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick on a call with reporters.

 High-growth technology stocks have come under pressure this year as the poor performance of shares and falling analyst confidence sours investor sentiment.

 Common with other high-growth tech firms, Robinhood has yet to turn a profit since its market debut. The company reported a net loss of $392 million or $0.45 per share in the three months ended March. A year earlier, which was before its IPO, it company posted net loss of $1.4 billion or $6.26 per share.

 Analysts on average had expected a net loss of $0.36 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

 Total net revenues decreased to $299 million, compared with $522 million a year earlier.

 Robinhood's monthly active users fell 10% to 15.9 million for March 2022, compared with 17.7 million for March 2021. The company attributed the decline to users with lower balances.

 Transaction-based revenue from cryptocurrencies, which has been a boon for Robinhood in previous quarters, fell 39% to $54 million.

Nagaraj Shetti at HDFC Securities said the short-term trend of the Nifty50 continues to be negative.
That said, hereâ€™s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesdayâ€™s action:


US Stocks Whipsaw After Brief Rally
Stocks whipsawed on concern the Federal Reserve may have to take a more aggressive stance to combat soaring prices, a move that would raise the risks of pushing the economy toward a recession.

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last down more than 180 points, or 0.6% after rising more than 500 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slipped about 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, stepping back an early rally.


European Stocks Rise From Two-Month Low
European stocks gained slightly on Tuesday as traders returned to risk assets, encouraged by cheaper valuations following four straight days of steep declines amid fears of a recession and tighter monetary policy.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed up 0.7% after hitting a two-month low in the previous session.


Tech View: Indecisive Candle
Nifty50 fell for the third day and continued with its lower high-low formations. The index made an indecisive candle on the daily chart, with a long upper wick, as the bears thwarted the bulls' attempt to make a comeback.


F&O: Resistance at 16,500
On the call side highest OI was witnessed at 16,500, followed by a 16,700 strike price, while on the put side, the highest OI was at 16,000, followed by a 16,200 strike price, providing support to the Nifty index.


Stocks Showing Bullish Bias
Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade setup on the counters of Oracle Financial Services.

The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

2022-04-11,MFI loan rates surge as lenders price risks,"At least half-a-dozen MFIs including Arohan have revised their lending rates upward in the first week of April. They have fixed their rates 100-350 basis points higher at 23-24% per annum, excluding processing fees, industry sources said.","AgenciesThe microfinance arm of the Muthoot Pappachan Group plans to revise rates from Monday.Kolkata: Borrowing costs for bottom-of-the-pyramid customers have begun to climb as the regulator removed the margin cap on NBFC-MFIs. Certain lenders have revised their lending rates upward by as much as 350 basis points as they apply risk-based pricing to arrest the asset quality degradation and the loss they suffered in the last three years. Several others are expected to follow suit, industry captains said.

""With the deregulation of interest rates, we can now price for credit risk. So, a new-to-credit customer would pay slightly higher rates. But they can enjoy the benefit of lower rates after a few credit cycles if they show good credit behaviour and repayment record,"" Arohan Financial Services managing director Manoj Kumar Nambiar told ET.

At least half-a-dozen MFIs including Arohan have revised their lending rates upward in the first week of April. They have fixed their rates 100-350 basis points higher at 23-24% per annum, excluding processing fees, industry sources said. 

""Please do remember that effective median rates of deregulated entities (read: universal banks, small finance banks and non-banking finance companies) was around 24% before the uniform regulations on microfinance,"" Nambiar said.

The rise in incremental costs of borrowing for NBCF-MFIs is another reason behind the abrupt change in lending rates.

""Hardening of market interest rates is the real reason. Bond yields have risen to 7%,"" said Sadaf Sayeed, chief executive of Muthoot Microfin.

The microfinance arm of the Muthoot Pappachan Group plans to revise rates from Monday.

The sharper rise in lending rates is likely for new customers with no credit history as risk-based pricing will be introduced given the fact that every lender suffered huge losses during the last three years, the chief executive of a north India-focused MFI said.

Credit bureau CRIF High Mark recently flagged that about â‚¹24,500 crore - which is 9.3% of the total microfinance portfolio of â‚¹2.64 lakh crore - remained unpaid even after 180 days of the due date, driving credit costs high for all microfinance lenders including NBFC-MFIs, impacting their profit numbers. 

""There may be temporary upward movement but gradually it will come down. Interest rates will reduce with good credit behaviour and repayment track record,"" said Satya MicroCapital managing director Vivek Tiwari.

Earlier, in a regulated rate regime when interest rates charged by MFIs to borrowers were fixed based on a maximum 10% margin over costs of funds, the average rate of interest had come down to 20.83% during the third quarter of FY22 from 23.66% during the second quarter of FY21, according to sources. Based on the new uniform regulations, which came into force on April 1, all the lenders engaged in microfinance have to put in place a board-approved well-documented interest rate model/approach for arriving at the all-inclusive interest rates.",Negative

 For the quarter ended 31-03-2022, the company reported a Consolidated Total Income of Rs 4485.01 Crore, up 4.80 % from last quarter Total Income of Rs 4279.64 Crore and up 3.44 % from last year same quarter Total Income of Rs 4335.94 Crore.

Investment RationaleACCâ€™s Q1CY22 EBITDA of Rs6.35bn (down 26% YoY) was broadly in-line with consensus estimates. Total cost/te continued its upward trajectory as it rose 1.6% QoQ and 13% YoY primarily due to higher fuel prices, while blended realisations were up 2.7% QoQ and 5.0% YoY, resulting in blended EBITDA/te increasing 12% QoQ but declining 24% YoY to Rs812/te (I-Sec: Rs779/te). Volumes including clinker sales were down 2% YoY and up 2% QoQ at 7.8mnte. Factoring in higher cost escalations, it cuts CY22E-CY23E EBITDA by 16-3% and reduces target price to Rs2,615/sh (earlier: Rs2,710/sh) based on 11x Marâ€™24E EV/E. It maintains BUY.

REUTERS/Shailesh AndradeCapital markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday tweaked the cyber security and cyber resilience framework for stock brokers as well as depository participants and mandated them to conduct a comprehensive cyber audit at least once in a financial year. Along with the cyber audit reports, stock brokers and depository participants have been asked to submit to stock exchanges and depositories a declaration from the MD and CEO certifying compliance by them with all Sebi guidelines and advisories related to cyber security issued from time to time, according to a circular.

Under the modified framework, they should identify and classify critical assets based on their sensitivity and criticality for business operations, services and data management.

Further, business-critical systems, internet-facing applications/systems, systems containing sensitive data, sensitive personal data, sensitive financial data, and personally identifiable information data, among others, should all be considered critical assets.

All auxiliary systems that connect to or communicate with critical systems, whether for operations or maintenance, must be designated as critical systems as well.

The board of the stock broker or depository participant is required to approve the list of critical systems.

""To this end, stock brokers/ depository participants shall maintain an up-to-date inventory of its hardware and systems, software and information assets (internal and external), details of its network resources, connections to its network and data flows,"" Sebi said.

According to Sebi, stock brokers and depository participants must conduct regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Tests (VAPT) that include critical assets and infrastructure components in order to detect security vulnerabilities in the IT environment and an in-depth evaluation of the security posture of the system through simulations of real attacks on its systems and networks.

Stock brokers and depository participants are required to conduct VAPT at least once in a financial year. Further, they are required to engage only CERT-In empanelled organisations for conducting VAPT.

Within a month from the completion of the VAPT, the final report must be submitted to Sebi with the approval of the technology committee of respective stock brokers and depository participants.

""Any gaps/vulnerabilities detected shall be remedied on immediate basis and compliance of closure of findings identified during VAPT shall be submitted to the stock exchanges/depositories within 3 months post the submission of final VAPT report,"" the regulator said.

Last month, the regulator came out with a modified cyber security and cyber resilience framework for market infrastructure institutions-- stock exchanges, depository and clearing corporations-- and KYC registration agencies (KRAs).

2022-04-22,"Shyam Sekhar says popular market trends, themes scare him. Here's why","The storytelling repeatedly, Sekhar said, can take money into very good companies like an Asian Paints, or a Bajaj Finance or it can take it into very cyclical companies, which may not do well.","Shyam SekharRelatedThis Mohammed Rafi song makes Shankar Sharma think of today's marketWill the recent strength in retail flows into the stock market continue?ETMarkets Basics: All about PE ratio; 5 things to consider before making investment decisionNEW DELHI: Market veteran Shyam Sekhar says popular trends and themes in the market scares him and that for a reason.

A popular trend draws millions of investors to specific themes in the market. But trends do change over time and chances are high that many retail investors who are invested in the popular 'trend' may get trapped and find it difficult to shift to a new one, when that happens, leading to collateral damage. 

In a video posted on his YouTube channel ithoughtwealth, Sekhar said information in the past was limited and it was only through newspapers. Analysis was even lesser. The popularising of trend, he said, occurred under Harshad Mehta, who popularised the replacement cost theory and within no time everybody was calculating the replacement cost of everything.

That trend, he said, became so popular that it led to a bull market. Sekhar said his father, who was not usually interested in such trends, actually once asked him why he is not following the trend.

In short, it reached people who were otherwise focused on their business activity.

""It had reached people who were traders, people who were from other walks of life. So, the trend as a concept was created only to do this: bring in people who are not in the stock market, into the stock market, and make them very keenly interested in the trend.""

""This is so that whatever such investors do in the stock market will be within this trend. All the money will travel into the trend. Now, this is something which I found very scary,"" Sekhar added.

Sekhar said when he entered the stock market, he wanted his investing to be insulated from such trends.

""I wanted to do it in a place where valuation was justified and where the long-term potential would eventually protect my capital and grow it. But most people found the popular trend to be simple and straightforward. But, look what happened in Harshad Mehta time in 1994, also during the GDR boom; and in 2000 when we had dot com bust; it happened in 2008 when we had the infra boom and it also happened in 2018 in the smallcap boom. It is happening now again when we are having the micro-investing boom,"" he said.

Sekhar said thematic investing, which people like him used to escape from, is becoming a trend.

""That's a very difficult place to be because what you thought was an approach, which will keep you away from mistakes, is now the mistake because people are popularising a theme into a trend so that they can bring in more people. You also have this theme manifesting in different ways. You have multiple information sources for this. The popularising is happening through Telegram, WhatsApp and YouTube. It's also happening through webinars,"" Sekhar said adding that is why stocks are getting re-rated so fast these days.

""When I look at the bare mechanics of all this, how it all works, I see no difference between what operators like Harshad Mehta did in the early 90s. And then it happened again in 2002, during Ketan Parekh time. And again, during 2008 during the infra boom,"" he said. 

The storytelling repeatedly, Sekhar said, can take money into very good companies like an Asian Paints, or a Bajaj Finance or it can take it into very cyclical companies, which may not do well.

""So many chemical stocks, which I see today at peaks, can very well be in a very different place after 24 months. But the way it is told to you, the way you are fed with information and perspective, is such that there is only one side. There is no other side. This one-sided flow of information is the basic fuel to create a popular trend into which you can suck a million people. Regulation cannot do much,"" he said.

Sekhar said investors need to protect themselves.

""Decide whether you want to buy options into cocaine or you want to buy a Satvik pill,"" he said. 

Retail investors should not get trapped and that is what regulators and everybody wants, he said adding that when collateral damage happens, the weakest ones get hit the most. ""This has happened in all cycles and it's going to happen again,"" he warned.

It seems investors are expecting good sales from auto companies in April. The firms will publish their data at the beginning of the next month, but channel checks suggests they are going to be better than last month.

Emkay Global Financial Services said there are indications of a recovery in Tractors/2-Wheelers in April 2022. Apart from the low base of last year, Tractor volume growth is likely to be driven by improvement in farm income and some preponed purchases due to expected price hikes, while 2-Wheelersâ€™ growth should be supported by marriage/festive season demand.

Amid global shortages due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Indian farmers are benefiting from better crop realizations. Further, dealer interactions indicate robust volumes in both CVs and PVs.

The Nifty Auto index was up 3 per cent, led mainly by two-wheeler makers Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Hero Moto. M&M that makes tractors also rose about 4 per cent.

The bank talked in detail about the merger with HDFC and said its focus remains on improving market presence in each line of business, new initiatives in the retail business via launch of PayZapp 2.0 and Smarthub Vyapar and strengthening of the back-end infrastructure.

Analysts maintained their 'buy' rating on the stock post the meet and a few of them even see it as their top banking sector pick. This is even as they believe the bank stock may keep trading at lower premium valuations than in the past amid developments relating to the merger .

Their price targets on the counter suggest 18-46 per cent potential upside on the counter.

Kotak Institutional Equities said that the private lender's execution capability has been tested against cycles and the bank shows that it deserves premium valuation.

""However, the near term merger issues dominate discussion which would probably lead to a much lower multiple than what it has enjoyed previously,"" it said while maintaining an unchanged target at Rs 1,650.

Post-merger, HDFC Bank does not see (cash reserve ratio) CRR and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirements as a challenge, and plans to add half of the priority sector lending requirement via internal sourcing including affordable housing, with the rest via other sources, predominantly priority sector lending certificates (PSLCs).

""Given focus on liability generation and PSL sourcing, HDFC Bank is likely to be aggressive on branch addition, gold loans, SME loans and housing loans. Over the medium-to-long term, we expect HDFC Bank to be extremely competitive on wholesale loans as well; its strong net-worth is likely to be an advantage. Overall, we remain positive on HDFC Bank and reiterate it as our top pick,"" IIFL Securities said while suggesting a 12-month target of Rs 1,980.

For Edelweiss, HDFC Bank is its top pick as it feels merger negatives are priced-in while the high scale and better than peers' RoA is not.

""Post-merger, RoA will remain at nearly 2 per cent while RoE will get diluted due to higher capital. RoE will come back to pre-merger levels in 3-5 years. In the longer-term, there will be scope to improve RoA beyond 2 per cent as HDFCâ€™s liabilities get repriced and operating leverage kicks in; the excess will be used for further investments,"" Edelweiss.

Motilal Oswal is factoring in an 18 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in loan and 20 per cent growth in PAT over FY22-24E, with RoA of 2.1 per cent and RoE of 17.8 per cent in FY24. It has maintained 'Buy' on the stock with a target of Rs 1,850/share.

It said HDFC Bank explained its rationale for the merger and addressed key investor concerns in the analyst meet. Inclusion of mortgages will improve the portfolio mix while the drag of meeting PSL, SLR and CRR requirements is likely to be controlled, it said.

Given the expected liability build-up, Nirmal Bang expects intermittent impact on margins, but the structural outlook remains positive given the high market share in unsecured segments. This brokerage has a target of Rs 2,042 on the stock.

2022-06-13,A $17 billion loss puts LIC IPO among top Asia wealth losers,"Having plunged 29% since its May 17 debut, Indiaâ€™s biggest ever IPO now ranks second in terms of market capitalization loss since listing, as per data compiled by Bloomberg. ","The rout has worried Indiaâ€™s government, with officials saying the companyâ€™s management will â€œlook into all these aspects and will raise shareholdersâ€™ value.â€An eye-popping $17 billion wipeout in market value has made Life Insurance Corp of India one of the biggest wealth destroyers among Asiaâ€™s initial public offerings this year.

Having plunged 29% since its May 17 debut, Indiaâ€™s biggest ever IPO now ranks second in terms of market capitalization loss since listing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drop puts it just behind South Koreaâ€™s LG Energy Solution Ltd., which saw a more than 30% peak-to-trough decline in its share price after an initial spike on debut.

Almost a month after listing, LICâ€™s $2.7 billion IPO has turned out to be one of Asiaâ€™s biggest new stock flops this year, as rising interest rates and inflation levels globally hurt demand for share sales and with Indiaâ€™s stock market facing unprecedented selling pressure by foreigners. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is down more than 9% this year.

LICâ€™s shares are poised to fall for a 10th consecutive session, slipping as much as 5.6% Monday after a mandatory lock-up period for anchor investors ended Friday. The rout has worried Indiaâ€™s government, with officials saying the companyâ€™s management will â€œlook into all these aspects and will raise shareholdersâ€™ value.â€


Bloomberg
LICâ€™s long-delayed IPO was dubbed Indiaâ€™s â€œAramco momentâ€ in reference to Gulf oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co.â€™s $29.4 billion listing in 2019, the worldâ€™s largest. It was part of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s plans to expand the nationâ€™s capital markets. The share sale, which was oversubscribed by nearly three times, was aimed at narrowing the governmentâ€™s budget deficit after spending increased during the pandemic.

More pain could be ahead for the stock given its lackluster quarterly results, according to Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research with discount brokerage Profitmart Securities Pvt. â€œThe managementâ€™s communication with investors is confusing. They havenâ€™t held an analyst call after the results,â€ he said. â€œSo there is no clarity on how the company is planning to grow, what is going to be its strategy.â€

Investment RationaleSuvenâ€™s pharma CDMO sales (down 21% q/q to Rs2bn) were less than expected as the contribution from one Covid molecule wasnâ€™t as huge as expected. Specialty CDMO clocked sales of a good Rs1.3bn (up 30% q/q); formulation sales were Rs184m (up 28% q/q). The gross margin was steady at 69-70%. Staff costs and other expenses were higher (more transportation and distribution costs) at respectively 8.6% (avg. 6-6.5%) and 17.4% of sales (vs. avg. 14-15%). This translated to a 43% EBITDA margin. The higher tax rate (43% vs avg. 25-33%) eroded profit, which was Rs917m (42% y/y, adj. for the share of profit from rising pharma). The brokerage slightly trims earnings estimate, factoring in higher formulations sales (boosted from Casperâ€™s site) which would drag on margins. It retains Buy rating, with a lower TP of Rs.627 (earlier Rs.660).

With Mondayâ€™s move, Nifty has gone convincingly above 17,800. This was the first double top resistance for the market. The taking out of this point has resulted in Nifty dragging its support point higher. This makes the level of 17,800 a first pattern support in the event of any consolidation. 

Options data shows that the strikes of 18,000 has seen accumulation of almost equal number of Call and Put OI. The highest Call OI stays at 18500 levels. This makes the level of 18,000 an inflection point for Nifty.

The market may surge higher if Nifty is able to keep its head above 18,000. Any slip below this level will push the market in some consolidation again.

The daily RSI is 68.33. It has made a new 14-period high which is bullish. It continues to remain neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish and trades above the signal line. A rising window occurred on candles. It results out of a gap on the upside. Usually such formations tend to get resolved in the direction of the trend. However, this will need confirmation on the next trading day.

The opening of the markets and the trajectory that Nifty forms after the opening

will be crucial to decide the trend or the day. It would be absolutely necessary for Nifty to keep its head above the 18,000-level if the up move has to extend itself. 

Any slip below the 18,000 level will see the index getting pushed into consolidation again. It is highly recommended not chasing the high beta stocks and stay highly stock-specific in approach. The defensive pockets like pharma, IT, and FMCG may continue to see traction. Vigilant protection of profits is advised at higher levels.

2022-06-27,Asian stocks buoyed by Wall Street gains as easing oil cools inflation fears,GLOBAL-Asian stocks buoyed by Wall Street gains as easing oil cools inflation fears,"APTOKYO - Stocks gained in Asia on Monday amid improved risk sentiment after Wall Street rebounded strongly at the end of last week as oil prices eased, tempering fears of prolonged inflation and the accompanying aggressive Federal Reserve tightening.

 Treasury yields remained subdued and the dollar hovered near the lowest in more than a week as investors continued to assess the outlook for U.S. rate hikes, and the potential for a recession.

 Japan's Nikkei rallied 1.04%, while Australia's benchmark jumped 1.69%. 

 Chinese blue chips rose 0.54% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.46%.

 South Korea's Kospi gained 1.65%.

 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 1.31%.

 However, U.S. stock futures point to a 0.25% decline when those markets reopen. On Friday, the S&P 500 surged more than 3%, adding to an almost 1% gain on Thursday.

 ""We've had a decent end to the week in the U.S. markets and I think that's going to be the main scene for Monday here in Asia,"" amid a dearth of news or other new drivers, said Rob Carnell, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at ING.

 ""We've had two decent equity days on the run now. It's perhaps notable that you've had some consistency there."" 

 Crude oil fell in volatile trading on Monday as the market grapples with concerns that a global economic slowdown could depress demand versus worries about lost Russian supply amid sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. 

 Both Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell more than a dollar earlier. But, prices have rebounded with Brent at $112.78 a barrel, down 34 cents, and WTI at $107.17, down 45 cents. [O/R]

 U.S. long-term Treasury yields hovered around 3.13% after bouncing off a two-week low just above 3% at the end of last week as traders removed bets for hikes next year, but still pondered if aggressive tightening this year could trigger a recession.

 Yields have dropped from 3.456%, the highest in more than a decade, reached before the mid-month Fed meeting. Then, the central bank hiked rates by 75 basis points, the biggest increase since 1994, and signalled that a similar move is possible in July.

 ""The market remains focused in the trade-off between the policy response to high inflation and fears of a hard landing,"" Westpac rates strategist Damien McColough wrote in a client note.

 ""There will be ongoing discussions as to whether long-end yields have peaked, however we would not yet expect 10-year yields to fall materially or sustainably below 3%.""

 The dollar was steady on Monday, continuing to consolidate near the lowest since the middle of the month against major peers. 

 The dollar index - which measures the currency versus six rivals - was little changed at 104.01, after gradually gravitating over the past few sessions toward the June 17 low of 103.83.

Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Exide Industries and Oberoi Realty are seen as more attractive bets at this juncture.","Getty ImagesMumbai: The Reserve Bank of India's interest rate hike for the second straight month has not dampened investors' appetite for shares of companies sensitive to interest rate moves such as banks, real estate and automobiles. 

But, analysts warn that further rate increases could result in fewer stocks remaining attractive as investors assess the impact of higher interest rates on demand.

Analysts are positive on residential developers in the real estate space and autos, but are less optimistic about the lenders. Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Exide Industries and Oberoi Realty are seen as more attractive bets at this juncture.

""The way ahead for rate sensitives would depend on the extent of rate increases. I assume we will see another 60-85 bps (hike) based on our inflation forecasts,"" said Sanjeev Prasad, co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities. ""I don't think 150-175 bps of rate increases will lead to major demand destruction. However, if the RBI was to raise rates more linked to higher-than-expected inflation, then we would see challenges for demand,"" said Prasad.

The BSE Realty index ended up 0.28% at 3,227.36 on Thursday and the Auto index gained 0.27% at 26,015.04, a day after the RBI increased a key policy rate by 50 basis points. In May, the central bank had raised the rate by 40 basis points.

AgenciesHemang Jani, head of equity strategy-broking and distribution at Motilal Oswal, said RBI rate hike was an event risk which has been factored in, so the rate hike itself is not a negative development for rate sensitive stocks.

The Realty index is down 12% from April but the Auto index is up 8% since April. The Bank Nifty gained 0.4% to close at 35,085.45.

Siddarth Bhamre, research head at Religare Securities, finds auto and real estate stocks a more attractive proposition than banks.

""After a 50-bps hike, we have not seen a major fall in auto or banking names. Within rate sensitives, the auto sector is well poised, the index is 5-6% away from all-time highs with technical chart breakouts and formation of bullish positions,"" said Bhamre.

""The correlation that rate sensitives should fall on rate hikes does not work every time,"" he added. Bhamre does not prefer banks as much as this interest rate increase is not because of growth but supply side factors.

2022-06-24,This one factor holds a clue to when the worst FII selloff might end,"""There are fundamental reasons behind FII selloff. India was relatively expensive to start with and that has added some kind of fuel to the fire to the current account worsening for India as a consequence of the fuel prices rising and the consequent weakness to the currency,"" Raychaudhuri told ET NOW.","NEW DELHI: $39 billion and counting... That's how much foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have sold in the last nine months, making it the most brutal and longest such selling by them, even worse than the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008.

This record outflow, which started in October - also the time when benchmarks last hit record highs, has resulted in sharp drawdowns on Dalal Street. One can only thank the resilience of domestic investors who have cushioned the fall, in the absence of which the cuts could have been deeper.

What's grim for Indian investors is that analysts do not see a reversal in FII outflows anytime soon.

BNP Paribas' top equity strategist Manishi Raychaudhuri says while FII selling in India is overdone, it is something we have to brace for in the short term.

""There are fundamental reasons behind FII selloff. India was relatively expensive to start with and that has added some kind of fuel to the fire to the current account worsening for India as a consequence of the fuel prices rising and the consequent weakness to the currency,"" Raychaudhuri told ET NOW.

As an investor, whose assets are denominated in US dollars or in euro, if you are anticipating the destination currency, in this case the Indian rupee, to depreciate maybe another 3 per cent to 5 per cent, you would obviously hesitate to put money in that market, he explained.

Currently, the Indian rupee trades at record low levels of 78.40 against the US dollar. Higher interest rates in the US and a consequently stronger dollar diminish the appeal of assets in riskier emerging markets such as India. A weaker rupee further erodes FPIsâ€™ returns from Indian assets.

For now, the US Fed is likely to continue with steep rate hikes as suggested by its chief Jerome Powell. He during the Fed rate hike announcement earlier this month suggested that in order to combat inflation, the US central bank could hike the benchmark interest rate by another 0.75 percentage points in July. The Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by 75 bps - the biggest increase since 1994 - in June meet.

Analysts believe that a pause in Fed's rate hike cycle is essential for FII outflows to reverse.

""Rising inflation and resultant rate hikes by US Fed are the main reason behind the churn of FIIs from emerging markets to developed markets,"" said Hemang Jani, Head Equity Strategy, Broking and Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services in an interaction with ET NOW.

FII selling may continue for a while till the aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed comes to a halt, Jani added.

V K Vijaykumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial echoed similar views. He told ETMarkets that as long as the dollar and US bond yields appreciate, FIIs will continue to sell. ""They will stop selling only when dollar and bond yields stabilise, which in turn, will depend on US inflation rates and Fedâ€™s policy.""

FIIs' return holds significance as any signs of a slowdown in selloff or reversal could indicate that the market bottom is likely in place and that D-Street is poised for another leg of the rally.

While it is difficult to predict the exact point when the tide for FII flows will change, ArunaGiri N of TrustLine Holdings suggests that the FII money will come back much sooner than Fedâ€™s timeline for unwinding.

""Not only it will be sooner, but it will be much larger than what went out. This is one reason why some seasoned investors are expecting a melt-up (bull-run) for Indian markets next year (2023),"" he wrote in a note last month.

Investment RationaleANGELONE printed 15% growth in topline sequentially on a strong base (15% Q3), resulting in an 11% beat, led by better-than-estimated customer activity (higher average revenue-generating orders per customer) and stronger ancillary transactional revenue. The brokerage are comforted by ARGOâ€™s indicators of stabilisation, which include higher quality customer adds and improved activation levels. Controlled marketing and operating spends resulted in an all-time high EBITDA margin of 55%; nevertheless, management has guided that a strong focus on marketing and technology will be maintained in FY23E following the launch of Super app, with increased spending. Given the flat-fee model, ANGELONE is one of the best plays on the secular growth story in Indian capital markets and highest-conviction BUY. It raises FY22/23E earnings estimates by 13/23% based on managementâ€™s strong commentary about targeted client additions in FY23E/24E, but trim target multiple to 19x (from 20.5x) to account for higher costs of capital.

Rising energy prices added to worry about the persistence of consumer pain. Brent crude futures touched a two-month top of $122.43 a barrel after the European Union vowed to slash imports of Russian oil by year's end.

U.S. treasuries slumped on return from Monday's U.S. holiday, sending the yield of the 10-year bond up nearly 10 basis points (bps) to 2.8405%.

German bund yields rose 8.1 bps overnight after German consumer prices increased at their fastest pace in half a century, strengthening the case for an outsized European Central Bank interest rate hike in July.

Eurozone inflation data is due later on Tuesday.

Chinese Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figures showed another month of contraction in services and manufacturing activity, though at a reduced pace of decline.

In equities, S&P 500 futures gave up early gains to fall back to flat early in the Asian session, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan snapped a two-day winning streak and dropped 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1%.

""The focus now is really on the U.S. economy and China,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Bank in Singapore.

""The two largest economies in the world are slowing, for different reasons, and it's not great for the global growth trajectory.""

Factory output in the third-largest economy, Japan, also dropped sharply in April as Chinese demand withered, data on Tuesday showed.

May figures showed China's official PMI at 49.6, indicating a contraction in factory activity but at a slower pace than in April, when the figure was 47.4.

Growth concerns have put the brakes on a two-week rally for exporters' currencies globally and have steadied the U.S. dollar as investors have again leaned towards safety.

Hawkish remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller also wound back recent expectations that the Fed might pause for breath after hikes in June and July.

""I am advocating 50 (basis point hikes) on the table every meeting until we see substantial reductions in inflation. Until we get that, I don't see the point of stopping,"" Waller said.

Fed Funds futures fell sharply, especially contracts for the early months of next year, as investors braced for relentless interest rate rises that would push the benchmark rate towards 3% by mid 2023.

The dollar traded on Tuesday at $1.0744 per euro, up 0.3%, and 128.16 yen, about 0.4% higher.

The trade-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars fell, with the Aussie last down 0.2% at $0.7180 and the kiwi down 0.4% at $0.6530.

Oil prices rose after the European Union agreed to slash oil imports from Russia by the end of 2022.

U.S. crude futures rose to $117.70 a barrel.

The stronger dollar pushed spot gold a fraction lower to $1,848 an ounce. Bitcoin rallied hard overnight, jumping nearly 8% and topping $32,000 for the first time in three weeks. It sat just below there at $31,540 early in the Asian session.

Investment RationaleHindalco (HNDL IN)â€™s share price has fallen ~50% from its peak of March 2022 with investors having concern on its huge capex plans coinciding with falling aluminum prices and possibilities of earnings hit of Novelis amid recessionary fear in developed economies like US and Europe. The brokerage believe that the stock has factored in pessimism and market failed to single out the companies like HNDL whose earnings are relatively less susceptible to commodity prices and ~60% of EBITDA comes from conversion business which is intact. We believe that fundamentals of aluminum are robust and there should not be any major fall from current price of USD 2,500/t. However, with China increasing exports, global deficit may reduce and accordingly, it cuts average LME aluminium prices to USD 2,600/t in FY23E and USD2,400/t in FY24E, leading to 3%/6% cut in FY23E/FY24E EBITDA. With earnings cut and lower valuation multiple, we reduce our target price to Rs473 (earlier Rs573), valuing Novelis at 6.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA and Indian operations at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA. At CMP, the stock is trading at 4.0x FY24E EV/EBITDA, which is near to a decade low. Reiterate BUY.

Consolidated Ebitda rose 271 per cent YoY to Rs 7,942 crore from Rs 2,143 crore in the same quarter last year.

During the quarter, the companyâ€™s wholly-owned subsidiary, Adani Power Rajasthan, received payments towards domestic coal shortfall claims, along with carrying cost and late payment surcharge from Rajasthan DISCOMs pursuant to Supreme Courtâ€™s order dated February 27.

The company said electricity demand continued to grow strongly in India, driven both by economic growth and a heatwave in the north-western parts of the country. It is said that the recent geopolitical events in Europe have resulted in a sharp increase in global fuel prices, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

""This has in turn affected the ability of several thermal power plants in India to generate power at viable costs, restricting their output. As a result of supply constraints in face of a growing power demand, average market clearing price of electricity on exchanges rose to Rs. 8.23/kWh in the day,"" it said.

The company said its Ebitda growth was aided by prior period income recognition, greater shortfall claims due to high import coal prices, and higher merchant and short term tariffs and volumes.

Nifty is, however, faring a tad better as the headline index is still around 1,000 points away from entering the much-feared bear zone. With central banks hiking interest rates globally, the worries around inflation are now giving way to recession.

A mid-year survey of a dozen brokerages by ETMarkets shows that many analysts are not ruling out a dip of another 5-10 per cent within the calendar year 2022. If the predictions come true, then the bear market may be a reality soon as a drop to 14,882, or 20 per cent from peak, would confirm the rule of bears.

ETMarkets Smart Talk: Indiaâ€™s investable landscape wider than other EMs despite premium valuations: Piyush Sharma
Pankaj Pandey, Head â€“ Research, ICICIdirect, is among the most bullish in the lot as he believes that since most of the devils are known, we might not have major cracks from here.

Escalation of war and involvement of other nations, a persistently high inflation and a recession culminating in the west came out as top three looming concerns for the market.


Hereâ€™s what top brokerages said on what would be the three biggest concerns for the market:

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities
Inflation at global levels that will influence the policies of central banks on interest rates will be the key concern area going forward. Apart from this, geo-political issues in Europe and China region have to be closely monitored. If recessionary conditions start cropping up in the developed economies, then emerging economies will suffer a fallout from this.


Roop Bhootra, CEO - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers
Inflation, geopolitical uncertainties and fear of recession especially in developed markets are biggest concerns for the market in near term. Market has seen a major part of correction and valuations have also come down, and now major indices are trading at attractive levels. Hence, most of the fall is behind us.


Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities
We believe that there is definitely room for correction. We do not rule out the market reaching 14,000-14,500 levels. The biggest concern being the hike in interest rate, escalation of geopolitical issues and increase in crude oil prices.


Siddarth Bhamre, Religare Broking
We believe most of the recent concerns for equities globally have emerged from the Russia-Ukraine war. If war led supply bottlenecks remain then we may see this fight with inflation stretching leading to further correction in valuations. Less than normal monsoon may break the back of rural demand which has been anyway marred by high inflation. Lastly, financial shocks which may emerge due to fall in asset prices.


Punit Patni, Equity Research Analyst, Swastika Investmart
The biggest concerns for the market going ahead would be higher than expected inflation, intense rate hikes by central banks leading to a hard landing, and slow down of economic growth. Most of the negativity is already factored in and therefore levels are attractive. However, further 5-10% fall canâ€™t be ruled out.


Shiv Chanani, Head of Research, Elara Securities India
Continued geo-political uncertainty remains the biggest risk for the market as it would entail sustained higher energy prices and hence elevated inflationary pressures. Secondly, risk would emanate from significant economic slowdown, particularly in markets like the US which could impact export demand. Finally, continued inflationary pressure would mean margin pressure for companies and possibility of earnings downgrade.

The advance-decline ratio for the broader market remained skewed in favour of the bears, but analysts said certain technical parameters on Nifty50 are hinting at recovery ahead.

Certain positive factors cropped up on the lower time frame charts in the form of positive divergences apart from momentum oscillators, generating buy signals, said Mazhar Mohammed of Chartviewindia.in. 

""Moreover, in Monday's session, the Nifty50 managed to defend Fridayâ€™s low of 15,183 level. Hence, it appears that the Nifty50 is positioning itself for a pullback rally. Therefore, as long as it sustains above 15,181, it can stage a relief rally for an initial target of 15,600 level. Contrary to this, a close below 15,181 can extend the weakness towards the 14,900 level,"" Mohammed said.

Milan Vaishnav, Founder & Technical Analyst at Gemstone Equity Research, said with Friday's low point getting protected, the bullish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been confirmed. The RSI, he said, has crossed above 30 from the oversold situation and has laid a framework for the market to inch higher towards 15,500 as we do not have any incremental negative points to deal with, he added.

The index closed the day at 15,350.15, up 56.65 points or 0.37 per cent.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Head of Technical Research at Sharekhan said the index has been trading in the 15,200-15,400 range.

""On the higher side, 15,400 is acting as a stiff barrier. As long as the index stays below this level, it is expected to trade sideways to downward bias and can test 15,100-15,000 on the downside. On the flip side, if 15,400 gets taken out, the index will be set for a bounce-back towards 15,600-15,700,"" Ratnaparkhi said.

Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said that the short-term trend of the Nifty50 continues to be volatile with broader range movement. A decisive move above 15,500 could open an upside bounce in the market. Important support to be watched around 15200 level, Shetti said.

Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal said that the index took support at 32,400 but failed to surpass the 33,000 zone. The index formed a small bodied Bearish candle on a daily frame with a long lower shadow.

""Now, till it holds below 33,000, weakness may be seen towards 32,250 and 32,000 whereas hurdles are placed at 33,333 and 33,500 zones,"" Taparia said.

2022-05-25,Right time to play the startup theme on Dalal Street? What experts say,"Zomato zoomed close to 20 per cent, its biggest rise in a day since its listing in July last year, whereas Delhivery spiked close to 17 per cent to Rs 568.90 over its issue price of Rs 487 on Monday.","Getty ImagesBarring the latest debutant, Delhivery, all of the new age tech players are down up to 70 per cent from their 52-week highs.INSIGHTS 
    	                    Read Stock Insights by ET for a quick analysis
    	                NSEBSEOne97 Communications Ltd.PEER COMPANIESExplore NowNew Delhi: After the strong debut of logistics startup Delhivery and better-than-expected results from food aggregating platform Zomato, all newly-listed tech based platform stocks were in focus.

Zomato zoomed close to 20 per cent, its biggest rise in a day since its listing in July last year, whereas Delhivery spiked close to 17 per cent to Rs 568.90 over its issue price of Rs 487 on Monday.

However, the list of recently listed new age startup stocks is quite limited, confined with only half a dozen names including One97 Communications (Paytm), Zomato, FSN e-Commerce Ventures (Nykaa), PB Fintech, CarTrade Tech and Delhivery.

Barring the latest debutant, Delhivery, all of the new age tech players are down up to 70 per cent from their 52-week highs. It means that these companies need to rise more than 200 per cent to hit their previous highs.

Stocks like Paytm and Zomato have eroded more than two-third of their value from the 52-week highs. CarTrade is down by 62 per cent from its all time high, followed by PolicyBazaar, which is trading 52 per cent below its peak prices.

Adding more pain to the investors' scare, shares of Nykaa, Paytm, Zomato, PolicyBazaar and CarTrade Tech have wiped out more than 2.35 lakh crore of investors wealth from their peak.

Paytm alone has eroded more than Rs 85,000 crore from investors kitty, whereas Zomato has contributed about Rs 60,000 crore. Investors of Nykaa and PB Fintech have lost Rs 51,700 crore and Rs 34,500, respectively.

However, after the latest rout in the tech bases players, analysts have turned positive on these counters and believe that the worst is over for them. They are warning investors to allocate minimal capital in these stocks.

Yash Gupta, Equity Research Analyst at Angel One, said the correction in the startup universe began with the fall in the tech heavy Nasdaq. Similarly, the stocks have seen a turnaround with a rebound in the Nasdaq.

""We are neutral towards India's startup story at this point in time,"" he added. ""If there are long term investors who want to play the theme, can allocate a small fraction of their portfolio allocation to the story.""

None of the five previously listed startup stocks is trading above their issue price, with Nykaa being the only exception. Interestingly, Paytm and CarTrade did not visit their issue price even once.

Majority of the global and brokerage firms have a positive outlook on the new age startup counters, with decent target price, which suggest strong upside in the counters.

Global brokerage firm Goldman Sachs has a target price of Rs 1,070 on Paytm. It said ""Paytmâ€™s lending business has been scaling up well, while maintaining good credit metrics, which it believes should further help allay investor concerns.""

Morgan Stanley has maintained 'overweight' for the food delivery firm Zomato with a target of 135. It noted that the company is moving in the right direction, but needs consistent execution to meet the high expectations.

Domestic brokerage firm ICICI Securities has a hold rating on 'Nykaa' with a target price of Rs 1,250 as the competition in the e-BPC space further weakens the upside, whereas it has a 'buy' rating of PB Fintech with a target price of Rs 776.

However, not everyone is going all guns blazing the startup stocks. A few analysts said that despite the worst is over for these counters, there are serious concerns over cash flows and profitability of their companies.

Ajit Mishra, VP- Research at Religare Broking, said that these companies are now looking to improve their operation performance and bottomline, but one should actually wait for this to turn into a reality before taking a call.

Investors should be comfortable with valuations, along with growth prospects, cash flows and profitability, he added. ""One can allocate a small portion of capital in such stocks, if they wish, but it's better to be late than taking undue risk.""

2022-05-05,Bamboozled by unscheduled RBI rate hike? Heres what to do with your portfolio,JM Financial Institutional Securitiesâ€™ MD & Chief Strategist Dhananjay Sinha suggests a few key themes for portfolio management.,"RelatedRate actions show RBI's flexibility, will help markets: SBI chief Dinesh KharaKey takeaways from surprise RBI rate hike: What investors should look forPandemic-era monetary largesse done and dusted, RBI announces emergency rate hikeNEW DELHI: After bleeding on Wednesday following the Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s decision to announce a hike in benchmark policy rates in an unscheduled statement, the domestic equity market recouped some losses today. With the surge in global commodity prices following the Ukraine war having significantly increased upside risks to Indiaâ€™s inflation, markets were bracing for tighter monetary policy but few were expecting the shift to a higher interest rate regime so soon.

JM Financial Institutional Securitiesâ€™ MD & Chief Strategist Dhananjay Sinha suggests a few key themes for portfolio management.

â€œWe have been guarding against rate sensitive, cyclical sectors such as banks, capital goods, industrials, etc. as they will be impacted by slower growth; we maintain that view. We have also been consistent in highlighting the valuation risks in small and mid-caps segments,â€ Sinha said.

â€œWe continue to favour a balanced portfolio with higher weights on domestic non-cyclicals and other defensive components such as pharma, technology, utilities, etc.â€

Higher interest rates translate into higher cost of capital for firms as loans get dearer. Another way stocks would stand to be impacted is erosion of valuations caused by higher sovereign bond yields, which represent the risk-free borrowing rate in the economy.

Yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond shot up 26 basis points on Wednesday to end at 7.38 per cent. Bond prices fall when bond yields rise.

â€œWe continue to maintain that the India 10 year Gsec yield will harden further to 7.75% with an upside risk; expect INR/USD at 80 and Nifty50 range at 17,500-15,000, with downside risk in the near term,â€ Sinha said.

According to the analyst, the RBIâ€™s move today may just be the tip of the iceberg as there exists plenty of room for rates to head higher from where they are right now.

â€œAfter the 40bp hike the real repo rate would still be -1.6% (4.4%-core inflation of 6%), significantly lower than an estimated neutral rate of 1%,â€ Sinha said.

â€œAnd if the RBI wants to achieve price stability through monetary policy normalisation, the real rate has to go above 1%. Thus, there is plenty of room for further rate hikes and liquidity normalization, going forward.â€


BEARISH EARNINGS VIEWWith monetary accommodation being withdrawn at a time when the recovery in demand is still modest and fiscal impulses negative, the earnings trajectory of Indian companies is set to be affected, Sinha said.

According to the strategist, the spending growth of 4.6 per cent outlined in the Union Budget for the current financial year is negative in real terms.

â€œIn our view, the 16-17% consensus growth assumption for NIFTY50 companies for FY23-FY24E after a post-COVID rebound of 40% in FY22E is very optimistic. Thus, our guidance of a 15-20% cut in estimates in the next 24 months appears realistic.â€

For the day, the index closed at 15,638.80, up 288.65 points or 1.88 per cent.

Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research said Tuesdayâ€™s comeback was much anticipated and on expected lines, thanks to the bullish RSI divergence that had developed over the past couple of days.

Vaishnav said a strong-bodied bullish candle reflected a directional consensus among market participants.

â€œImportantly, a rising window emerged on the candle; this results out of a gap on the upside and mostly resolves with the continuation of the trend subject to confirmation. Apart from some consolidation that can be expected, the Nifty50 is likely to inch higher towards the 15,700-15,750 zone; this is the pattern support that it had violated on its way down. In the future, Nifty50 has a gap to negotiate between 15,800-15,160 levels,â€ he said.

â€œMoreover, the lower end of the bearish gap zone of 15,886 and 16,172, registered on June 13, is also nearby from the current levels. Hence, the upsides look capped between 15,850-900 levels.

As the economy recovers, analysts said they are more bullish on the two stocks than ever.

PVR and Inox Leisure have a consensus recommendation of 'Strong Buy,' shows Trendlyne data, with their average price targets suggesting up to 30 per cent upside for the two stocks.

Brokerage JM Financial, which recently initiated coverage on the stocks with 'Buy' calls, believes that PVR and Inox Leisure, after having withstood the worst of the pandemic, are now slated to post the best ever year in FY23 on account of bunched up movie releases, increased adoption of regional cinemas, new screen additions, higher ticketing and food & beverage spends.

Over the last two financial years, both these companies have posted massive losses. PVR's consolidated net loss stood at Rs 747.80 crore in FY21 and Rs 488.50 crore in FY22. For Inox Leisure, it was Rs 337.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 239.40 crore in FY22. Despite this, shares of these companies have added 65-100 per cent over the two years.

Given the high entry barrier and oligopolistic nature of the industry, these companies could deliver steady revenue growth and improved margins, as well as return on invested capital (RoIC) over a long period of time, analysts said.

The signs of recovery were visible in the month of March itself as most Covid-19 restrictions were removed and theatrical movie releases followed. Going ahead, ticket price hikes going ahead and higher spends per head could drive the underlying profitability compared to pre-Covid levels, analysts said.

""In our view, the ongoing recovery reinforces the relevance of cinemas for Indian consumers, amidst higher levels of OTT adoption, and a strong theatrical release pipeline should help normalise footfalls to pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, PVR and Inox are also expected to aggressively add screens which are now getting delivered thereby driving growth over the medium term,"" Manish Agarwal of JM Financial said.

PVR looks to add 125 screens in FY23 and Inox Leisure 77 screens. 

Brokerage Nirmal Bang Institutional Research projects that PVR and Inox Leisure can deliver at least 5-10 per cent volume or footfall growth per year over the next 10 years. This, it said, will result in revenue CAGR of 10-15 per cent, with Ebitda and PAT growing a tad faster as the revenue mix turns margin rich.

Rise in relevant customer households, which can afford this type of entertainment (currently at 15 per cent of total), is going to drive demand, it added.

For Indian consumers, multiplexes remain a major out of home entertainment option given the lack of alternatives across cities, and PVR and Inox both remain well poised to benefit from the imminent recovery with strong balance sheets and well-established brands, Agarwal said.


Merger Synergies
Analysts believe that both companies, following the merger, will benefit from the scale of expansion, faster growth trajectory and other revenues and cost synergy.

""Should the merger go through, we believe that it would lead to significant bargaining power for the merged entity vis-Ã -vis ecosystem partners like mall operators, film producers/distributors, advertisers and consumers,"" Nirmal Bang said.

While the merger did not require the approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), we expect it to be contested by CCI at some point in time, it added. This could delay the consummation of the merger from the current indicated timeline and is a key risk, Nirmal Bang said.

Apart from this, volatility induced by the success of content and resurgence of Covid-19 could also pose challenges for these companies, analysts believe.

2022-04-02,Rating upgrades reveal India Inc in better financial health,"The industry credit ratio, a gauge for financial health measured as a proportion of upgrades vis-a-vis downgrades, surged 172 basis points year-on-year to 2.81, data from Prime Acuite Rating Database showed. Prime Acuite compiled data from seven local rating companies.","Getty ImagesRating companies are optimistic about higher ratings for borrowers, but surging inflation and its potential impact on growth could restrain the quantum of debt on balance sheets.Financial health of Indian companies improved the most in nearly a decade, evident in the highest number of rating upgrades last fiscal, as most borrowers restrained expenses and sweated existing assets to lighten their balance sheets through the pandemic.

The industry credit ratio, a gauge for financial health measured as a proportion of upgrades vis-Ã -vis downgrades, surged 172 basis points year-on-year to 2.81, data from Prime Acuite Rating Database showed. Prime Acuite compiled data from seven local rating companies.

One basis point is 0.01%.

This is possibly the highest level for the gauge in a decade. The data set was updated until March 29 of FY22.

""While consumer sentiment and demand are likely to improve this year, the uncertainty over Russia-Ukraine geopolitics and US Fed policy could play the spoilsport,"" said K Ravichandran, chief rating officer at ICRA Ratings. ""With credit growth picking up, you can expect capex from renewable energy, steel, infrastructure (rail/road), oil and gas as select companies have adequately deleveraged last year.â€


Rating companies are optimistic about higher ratings for borrowers, but surging inflation and its potential impact on growth could restrain the quantum of debt on balance sheets.

â€œHowever, capex related borrowing would not be widespread but limited amid the evolving economic scenario,"" Ravichandran said.

The total number of upgrades was 3,564, versus 1,267 downgrades during FY22. This was in stark contrast to the preceding year, which witnessed 2,276 upgrades vis-Ã -vis 2,096 downgrades.

Chemical companies along with entities from pharmaceutical, ferrous metals, power, road and constructions sectors made up the largest share of upgrades.

â€œThe uptrend in the credit quality can be attributed to higher demand with the economy opening up,â€ said Sachin Gupta, chief rating officer at CARE Ratings.

Government spending on infrastructure and dedicated schemes such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and Production Linked Incentives (PLI) has helped improve creditworthiness.

â€œThe impact of the China + 1 strategy aided the recovery to a large extent,â€ Gupta said.

Several global companies are looking beyond China to prevent recurrence of supply disruptions caused in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. India is set to benefit from such a de-risking strategy.

CareEdge Ratings has clocked a decadal high credit ratio at 2.64 in the second half of the fiscal year on a standalone basis, which points toward a positive credit outlook.

â€œThe sharp rise in the aggregate credit ratio for the credit rating agencies clearly reflects the steady revival of the domestic economy in FY22 despite a couple of bouts of the Covid pandemic,â€ said Suman Chowdhury, chief analytics officer, Acuite Ratings & Research.

â€œIt also reflects the expectations of healthy growth in FY23 amid the governmentâ€™s thrust on the infrastructure segment, solid coverage on vaccination, and moderate recovery in rural consumption,â€ he said.

Revival is, however, likely to be partly offset by high crude oil prices and higher than expected inflationary pressures. Higher commodity prices will also weigh on corporate margins, leaving companies with limited elbow room for passing on increased costs.

While local funding costs will likely rise this fiscal year, the US Federal Reserve policy on liquidity unwinding/rate increases would also help chart out future growth potential of companies.

Credit Ratio, according to Crisil Rating, may moderate due to two reasons: High commodity prices and lower cost savings due to higher travel-related expenses for corporate executives.

2022-06-06,"Export levy, domestic surfeit can dent bottom lines of steelmakers","In fact, since the beginning of the ongoing fiscal year on April 1, domestic steel prices have come down by 17%, and are now below their year-ago levels. However, raw material prices remain elevated, which would weigh on the performance of steelmakers such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and SAIL.","AgenciesIndia's total steel capacity is 149 million tonnes (including semifinished steel), while its local consumption is only 106 million tonnes. ETIntelligence Group: India's top steel companies are expected to take a hit on their profitability because of the increase in export duty. Domestic steel prices have fallen 8% since the duty was increased late last month and may correct further, say analysts, even though manufacturers had guided for a limited impact from the event.

In fact, since the beginning of the ongoing fiscal year on April 1, domestic steel prices have come down by 17%, and are now below their year-ago levels. However, raw material prices remain elevated, which would weigh on the performance of steelmakers such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and SAIL.

Much of the fall in domestic prices is linked to the duty hike, as international steel prices (Chinese FOB prices) are down only 9% since April 1.

Steel prices are currently around â‚¹63,500 a tonne compared with â‚¹67,000 in June last year. During the same period, the prices of key raw materials, coking coal and iron ore increased by 140% and 49%, respectively. This could lead to a sharp reduction in profitability for the steel manufacturers in FY23.

Just to give a perspective, Ebitda/tonne for the March quarter for Tata Steel (India), JSW Steel, JSP and SAIL were lower by 30%, 48.5%, 47% and 55%, respectively, from their peak (in the quarter ended June 30, 2021). For Tata Steel, the impact was the least because it owns iron ore mines. The coming quarters could see a further deterioration in this performance, as analysts say the likely fall in exports due to the higher duty would not be offset by local consumption, as the domestic market cannot absorb the excess capacity created over the years.

Agencies
India's total steel capacity is 149 million tonnes (including semifinished steel), while its local consumption is only 106 million tonnes. The capacity has increased close to 7% over the past 15 years, while consumption has increased by a little over 5%. 

In FY22, India exported 13.5 MT (18.5 MT including semifinished steel). Out of this close to 10.5 MT were of flat, cold-rolled and other value-added products. Companies have said on record that they will continue to export these value-added products, at the cost of their profitability, as they cannot stop business with clients developed over the years. The remaining 3 MT (8.5 MT including semifinished steel) will be routed to the domestic market, which will lead to higher local supplies and thus lower realisations.

Earnings for steel companies are very sensitive to external factors. In the past, these companies have seen from going highly profitable to loss-making in less than a year.

Developments over the past few weeks have left some analysts downgrading earnings estimates of the sector. The estimated earnings for FY23 for the top four players are expected to be significantly lower - for some, less than half - compared with FY22. However, valuations remain on the higher side, so investors may be better off avoiding these stocks.",Negative
2022-06-23,Analysts are bullish on this Rs 667 crore-Jhunjhunwala bet.

Revenue growth and margin expansion will go hand in hand, analysts who read the annual report said, adding that the recent guidance is realistic and achievable.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his wife Rekha owned a total 2.12 per cent stake in the hotel as of March 31, which is valued at Rs 667 crore as of Thursdayâ€™s trade. 

The annual report, said Motilal Oswal Securities, highlights the companyâ€™s efforts to grow its existing and new businesses, improve its margins, and deploy its capital efficiently to generate better returns. It sees the stock at Rs 278.

ICICI Securities has cut its target for the stock marginally to Rs 284 from 292. The two price targets suggest 29-31 per cent upside over Wednesdayâ€™s closing price of Rs 215.60.

On Thursday, the scrip rose 2.97 per cent to hit a high of Rs 221.60 

The companyâ€™s FY22 annual report reiterates the companyâ€™s plans to execute its â€œAHVAAN 2025â€ strategy, which it announced in May.

The strategy essentially focuses on four key pillars including reaching a total of 300-plus hotels across the portfolio and clocking a consolidated Ebitda margin of 33 per cent by FY26 with 35 per cent Ebitda share from management contracts and new businesses. The company also wishes to achieve a 50:50 ratio between owned/leased and management contract room keys and is looking to retain a net cash balance sheet while pursuing its growth plans. 

â€œThe AHVAAN strategy is an extension of the company's earlier Aspiration 2022 strategy which focused on asset light expansion and improvement in margins. We believe that the growth and margin targets set by the company management are realistic,â€ said ICICI Securities.

The brokerage estimates FY23 consolidated revenue to grow 54 per cent YoY to Rs 462 crore, which would be 104 per cent of FY20 level. It sees FY24 revenue to grow 18 per cent YoY to Rs 5,450 crore at an Ebitda margin of 32 per cent.

The company said its April and May revenues were 10 per cent higher than pre-Covid levels and with sustained pickup in business travel along with leisure, ICICI Securities expect FY23E revenue and FY24E revenue at 104 per cent and 122 per cent of pre-Covid (FY20) levels, respectively.

Motilal said IHCLâ€™s asset-light model, and new and reimagined revenue-generating avenues, with higher Ebitda margins, bodes well for an expansion in RoCE. 

Like FY22, it expects a strong recovery in FY23 and FY24, led by an improvement in ARR once economic activity normalizes; improved occupancies, led by business travelers as well as the Leisure segment and cost rationalisation efforts.

This brokerage also sees an increase in F&B income as banqueting/conferences normalises and higher income from management contracts.

2022-04-13,Valuation bloat in stocks and bonds is catching up with the bull market,â€‹â€‹The S&P 500 has dropped in five of the last six days while yields on 10-year Treasury notes is set to break a streak of seven straight increases.,"APWhile interest-rate hikes get all the press, an equally big problem for bulls is valuations, with years of price appreciation leaving equities and fixed-income at nosebleed altitudes relative to cash flows.The economic cycle is advancing to a point where valuations may finally matter again for stock and bond investors.

Fortress-like in their refusal to bend for the better part of a decade, both asset classes have come under pressure thanks to the ever-stiffening resolve of central banks to restore order to the global economy. 

The S&P 500 has dropped in five of the last six days while yields on 10-year Treasury notes is set to break a streak of seven straight increases.

While interest-rate hikes get all the press, an equally big problem for bulls is valuations, with years of price appreciation leaving equities and fixed-income at nosebleed altitudes relative to cash flows. 

A novel way of measuring the bloat was proffered in a note by JonesTrading, which added together the S&P 500â€™s earnings yield and the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries. Combined, the total yield -- what the firm called its â€œreverse Fed modelâ€ -- stands at 7.2% today, even with the runup in bond rates. Thatâ€™s lower than 93% of the time since data began in 1962. 

Worse, income from the assets is dwindling due to inflation. With consumer-price increases running at 8.5%, itâ€™s the first time in six decades that the combined asset yields have sat below the inflation rate.

Bloomberg
â€œHistorically, investors have been more diligent to reprice stocks and bonds to ensure there is reward for taking on the added risk,â€ Michael Oâ€™Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in an interview. â€œThe market believes the Fed will blink at the first sign of asset price weakness.â€

That two major financial assets are so richly priced conceivably creates trouble for investors who just endured their worst quarter in decades, going by the breadth of losses across markets. Stocks and bonds have fallen this year in a rare concerted selloff as the Federal Reserve turned hawkish, embarking on whatâ€™s expected to the most aggressive rate-hike cycle since 1994. 

At 4.4%, the S&P 500â€™s earnings yield -- the higher-is-cheaper reciprocal of the more widely followed price-earnings ratio -- sports one of the lowest readings in decades. The rate on 10-year Treasuries, despite reaching a three-year high of 2.78% Monday, offers less than half what it has done historically. 

Stocks look expensive as well based on other metrics. Roughly 17% of members in the Russell 3000 Index are trading at more than 10 times their revenues, a proportion that exceeded even the dot-com era, according data compiled by Strategas Securities.


Bloomberg
â€œWhile it is true that the share prices for many of the high flyers are down dramatically, there could be more room for them to decline,â€ said Ryan Grabinski, a strategist at Strategas. â€œOne has to wonder how much investors will be willing to pay for these speculative names when the cost of capital is no longer free. Not to mention many of these companies produce zero profits and more often than not, require additional capital to fund their businesses.â€ 

For his â€œreverse Fed model,â€ Oâ€™Rourke at JonesTrading adapted a framework that according to a July 1997 report by the central bank compares the relative value of stocks and bonds to identify a more attractive asset.

In the eyes of Oâ€™Rourke, both assets are priced as if they are in a bubble, inflated by an unprecedented period of Fed monetary support. To prove his point, he summed up the yields from Treasuries and stocks to show how little investors are getting nowadays relative to history.

This would be an astounding growth for the world's biggest and cash-rich T20 league, whose broadcasting rights were sold for Rs 16,300 crore in the previous cycle (2018-2022).

The brokerage expects T20 leagues' annual media rights to hit Rs 10,000 crore-mark, which was Rs 3,220 crore in the last cycle and Rs 820 crore in the first cycle.

In the new season, IPL will host 94 matches, spanning over 10-11 weeks. All 10 teams will play a round-robin tournament, facing each other twice and four matches for playoffs.

The fifteenth edition of IPL concluded two weeks ago where debutants Gujarat Titan clinched the title after defeating Rajasthan Royals. The other debutant, Lucknow Supergiant, made their way to the playoffs.

According to Elara Capital, digital rights are likely to command the most premiums, close to 100 per cent over the current base price, whereas TV rights will command a 40 per cent premium.

The brokerage firm expects 6 per cent annualised growth in revenue for the TV rights owner and 35 per cent annualised sales growth for digital rights owners for IPL matches over the next five years.

""This in turn should massively bolster India's sports media rights market. IPLâ€™s share may grow to 74 per cent from 54 per cent currently, reviving its importance,"" the brokerage said.

IPL rights renewal should yield the biggest delta for SunTV â€“ the owner of Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) â€“ as SRHâ€™s valuation may spike the most, even as the contribution to the future market cap may look skewed, the report said.

Mumbai Indians (MI) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) may contribute 0.7 per cent and 15.5 per cent to their owners Reliance Industries (RIL) and United Spirits (USL) market caps, respectively. However, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is likely to emerge as the biggest beneficiary. 

Karan Taurani, Sr Vice President, Elara Capital said CSK is one of the most successful teams in IPL with strong revenue growth and healthy EBIT margins. ""They have a robust fan following and brand value, attracting merchandise sales.""

Though, he warned about the potential decline in sponsorship and endorsement revenue, when MS Dhoni hangs his boots. ""This is the only near term challenge for the franchise, else other pointers are not a hurdle for them,"" said Taurani.

Chennai Super Kings is a multibagger counter, actively traded in the unlisted space. The scrip, after demerging from India Cements in November 2018, zoomed to Rs 240 during the latest season from merely Rs 12-15 in less than four years.

Commenting on CSK, Dinesh Gupta, co-founder, UnlistedZone said the stock has corrected to the Rs 180-level for now but the sale of media and broadcasting rights would be a major trigger for the South India-based franchise.

""Given valuations of two new franchises and CSK's sound track record with solid profit growth, it won't be a surprise it becomes India's first-ever sports unicorn,"" he added.

According to Elara's Karan Taurani, IPL can be a blessing in disguise for another company - Paytm, only if it has the exclusive rights to sell tickets for the next editions of the T20 league.

""Paytm will be able to leverage upon the increased number of users to other sectors as well from paying bills to other transactions,"" he added. ""If there is exclusivity in the ticket selling, Paytm will be able to acquire more customers.""

It expects the non-cigarette FMCG business to grow by 5 per cent due to lower volume growth.Hotels-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC is likely to report a relatively weak growth in net profit for the March quarter though revenue will likely grow at a strong pace thanks to its cigarette business.

ITC is scheduled to publish its March quarter numbers on Wednesday, May 18.

Analysts project the companyâ€™s net revenue to grow in the range of 11-23 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Though, sequentially, it is likely to be much lower. Net profit is estimated to grow 5-15 per cent YoY.

Analysts at brokerage firm Sharekhan said cigarette business revenue is expected to increase by 12-13 per cent YoY with volume growth of 11 per cent. It expects the non-cigarette FMCG business to grow by 5 per cent due to lower volume growth.

According to them, the hotel business is expected to continue to deliver strong growth due to higher mobility and pent-up demand while agri-business is expected to register strong double-digit growth led by higher exports.

Shares of the company have spiked recently as investors believe the war in Europe that has upended the food availability across the world, would ultimately benefit the company. Analystsâ€™ expectation affirms that. 

Though, â€œhigher input costs would lead to a 270 bps YoY decline in gross margin and a 137 bps YoY decline in operating margin. Sequentially, margins are expected to remain flat. PAT to grow by 4 per cent during the quarter,â€ Sharekhan said.

Axis Securities also expects cigarette volume to grow by 7-8 per cent YoY and the FMCG segment to grow at a modest 3 per cent on weak consumer sentiments. Meanwhile, it projects hotels (strong demand), papers and agri (geopolitical crisis) businesses to see strong growth.

The broker has outlined the highest growth estimates among brokerages. It sees PAT growth at 15 per cent driven by 23 per cent growth in sales. â€œExpect EBITDA margins would decline modestly despite gross margin contraction on account of operating leverage benefits (hotels, paper) and cost rationalization,â€ it further said.

At the end of the December quarter, ITC reported net profit growth of 13 per cent and sales growth of 31 per cent.

YES Securities, which projects Q4 sales growth at 14 per cent and profit growth at 5 per cent, said strong margin performance will continue for ITC, led by operational efficiency.

According to brokerages, key monitorables for Q4 are:
- Hotels & FMCG division outlook
- Cigarette demand and price trends, and
- Performance of Agri and Packaging divisions going ahead

In addition, they have been asked to refund the investors' money, along with interest.

Apart from F6 Finserve, F6 Commodities, those banned by Sebi are Pankaj Goel, Meenu Goel, Deepak Goel and Ruchika Goel.

In its order, Sebi observed that F6 Finserve and F6 Commodities are connected with each other on the basis of same registered office and common promoter-directors -- Pankaj Goel and Meenu Goel. While Deepak and Ruchika were former directors at F6 Finserve.

""I observe that the information and data gathered at the time of inspection unequivocally bring to light the various flagrant lapses noticed from the way both F6 Finserve and F6 Commodities were operating their broking operations and managing their clients' funds and securities.

""Further, the violations committed by F6 Finserve and F6 Commodities are undoubtedly grave in nature which have been carried out for a considerable period of time (almost 2 years),"" Sebi whole-time member S K Mohanty said in his order.

According to Sebi, F6 Finserve failed in its duty to correctly report the margins collected by it from its clients to the exchange, had not settled funds aggregating to Rs 1.43 crore of 891 clients who had not traded during the period, January to March 2017, and failed to redress investors' grievances.

""F6 Commodities has visibly aided and abetted F6 Finserve in misutilising its clients' funds,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) found.

In addition, F6 Finserve transferred the funds of one client to the other or to its promoter-director, as per its own convenience, without paying any heed to its obligation to maintain separate accounts for its client and for itself (proprietary account).

Also, it indulged in activities wherein the securities received from one client were noticed to have been transferred by the stock broker to another client, the regulator noted.

Further, F6 Finserve pledged the securities belonging to its clients to its lenders, it added.

Accordingly, the regulator said, ""Noticees No. 1 to 4, 9 and 10 (F6 Finserve, F6 Commodities, Pankaj Goel, Meenu Goel, Deepak Goel and Ruchika Goel) are hereby restrained from accessing the securities market in any manner and are also prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in the securities market, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever manner, for a period of 5 years""

The moves are expected to drive up the capital requirement for brokers and could make it more expensive for traders.","Agencies""The new Sebi rule is clear that if you (broker) want to fund a client, do that with your own money; not with another client's money,"" said the CEO of a leading broking firm.RelatedTrading in global stocks through GIFT IFSC: A win-win propositionMunger says retail trading firm Robinhood getting comeuppanceTraders Guide: How to identify low-risk trading strategies?MUMBAI: The cost of funding for traders and brokers is set to shoot up with the Securities and Exchange Board of Indiaâ€™s tighter margin rules set to kick in from May. Traders must bring in at least 50% of their futures and options margin requirement in cash starting Monday, while brokers cannot use the cash of one client for anotherâ€™s margin requirement to fulfil their margin requirement with stock exchanges. The moves are expected to drive up the capital requirement for brokers and could make it more expensive for traders.

Till now, brokers allowed trading clients to use pledged shares as collateral to initiate trades. Though clients were always required to bring in 50% of their total collateral in cash, brokers never enforced it. This is because exchangesâ€™ clearing corporations recognized margin requirements at the broker level, allowing firms to use cash from one client to make up for the deficiencies of others in its margin pool. The regulator felt that the arrangement of allowing the use of idle cash of one client to make up for the short-fall of others despite taking shares as collateral posed systemic risks, prompting it to tighten rules.

From Monday, clearing corporations must maintain separate margin accounts for every client of brokers. This makes it necessary for clients to bring in 50% cash as collateral to initiate trades. This means, if the margin required for a trade is Rs1 lakh, she must bring in Rs50,000.

Brokers can however fund the 50% cash collateral requirement, which clients need to bring, from its own capital.

â€œThe new Sebi rule is clear that if you (broker) want to fund a client, do that with your own money; not with another clientâ€™s money,â€ said the chief executive of a leading broking firm, who did not want to be identified.

Broking officials said the race will now be on the basis of which firm is able to offer better funding to larger clients.

""Some brokers will charge interest for funding the cash collateral, which essentially raises the cost of trading,â€ said B Gopkumar, MD and CEO, Axis Securities. Axis will not charge interest on cash margins, he said.

Zerodha, the countryâ€™s largest broker, said in its website that it would charge 0.035% per day or 12.5% per annum on the â€œshortfall in the cash margin requirementâ€. Various other large brokerages are believed to have informed clients that they will charge interest if 50% cash margins are not met.

Top broking executives said this rule could force firms to cough up more capital to service clients. The top official at another bank-owned broking firm said the cost of capital for brokers could go up by 18-25%. That would intensify the battle for market share in the ultra-competitive domestic broking industry, which works on low brokerage rates and wafer-thin margins.

â€œWhile the rule will be a big boost to the transparency levels in the industry, this will squeeze out some of the smaller brokers,â€ said Gopkumar.

Some smaller broking firms may however be tempted to stick to the old margin rules a bit longer as the penalty for not complying with the new rules will be imposed from July 1, said industry officials.

 Investor worries over rising interest rates in response to galloping inflation have roiled global markets.

 UK's FTSE 100 struggled as British inflation hit a 30-year high last month, while Wall Street's main indexes gave up early gains to close lower in the previous session as U.S. consumer prices in March rose to four-decade high.

 Meanwhile, earnings updates drove swings in individual stocks, with Britain's biggest retailer Tesco dropping 6% after it warned profit was likely to fall in the current year due to tough economic conditions.

 While the STOXX 600 has recovered from the sharp losses in March, the index has been trading in a tight range ahead of the first-quarter earnings season. Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase & Co will report earnings later in the day.

 ""I wouldn't be surprised to see some margin contraction in Q1, but then it should prove to be temporary as long as inflation peaks,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.

 ""Much more important than any surprises we get in Q1 is going to be the forward guidance and that will set the tone for markets.""

 Analysts expect profit for STOXX 600 companies to rise 25.1% in the first quarter, as per Refinitiv data, up from 20.8% seen at the start of April and 15% at the start of the year.

 Energy, basic materials and industrial companies are expected to be the biggest profit drivers in the quarter, while technology is expected to lag.

2022-06-02,"How India Inc defied Ukraine war, rate hike woes to post strong Q4","According to the brokerage, the pressure on margins faced by manufacturing businesses along with wage inflation in the IT sector had been offset by the earnings outperformance shown by the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector.","AgenciesThe rate hike plans outlined by central banks both at home and abroad to curb inflation have taken a toll on equity markets by dampening growth prospects and leading to tighter financial conditions.NEW DELHI â€“ The protracted war between Russia and Ukraine and the consequent surge in global commodity prices may have roiled equity markets worldwide over the last few months, but corporate Indiaâ€™s earnings in the last quarter displayed strength.

The rate hike plans outlined by central banks both at home and abroad to curb inflation have taken a toll on equity markets by dampening growth prospects and leading to tighter financial conditions.

So far in 2022, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 9.7 per cent. Even as the fall in domestic equities has not been as steep as the US index â€“ the Sensex has lost 5 per cent-â€“ the period has been one of intense volatility in stock markets.

â€œCorporate earnings, a true barometer of economic health, on the other hand, have been quite resilient with Nifty EPS for Q4FY22 coming in on broadly expected lines at Rs 207/share, up 10 per cent QoQ and YoY,â€ ICICI Securities said.

According to the brokerage, the pressure on margins faced by manufacturing businesses along with wage inflation in the IT sector had been offset by the earnings outperformance shown by the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector.

In the fourth quarter of the previous financial year, the BFSI sector enjoyed better-than-expected credit growth and an improvement in asset quality, the brokerage said.


ET CONTRIBUTORS
Across businesses, the management commentary in January-March was positive on the demand outlook in the midst of an improvement in economic activity, aggressive infrastructure spending outlay by the Centre and a revival in the private capex cycle.

ICICI Securities said in its note, however, that managements were wary of fresh escalation in input cost inflation, which could translate into broader price hikes and a slightly softer trajectory for margins.

Data released after trading hours on Tuesday showed that Indiaâ€™s GDP grew by 4.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of FY22.

According to economists from Nomura, while the moderation in GDP growth in the fourth quarter was primarily on account of a statistical base effect, the sequential momentum remained strong at 1.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter versus 2.0 per cent in October-December, suggesting an annualised momentum of 7.5 per cent.

â€œWe believe the present market volatility offers an attractive opportunity to build a long-term portfolio of quality companies, which have lean balance sheets, are capital efficient and have growth longevity,â€ ICICI Securities said.

Taking into account revised estimates for firmsâ€™ profit after tax after the fourth quarter, the brokerageâ€™s forward estimates do not undergo a major change.

Over a three-year horizon ending FY24, the brokerage sees Nifty earnings growing in excess of 20 per cent compounded annual growth rate while for the period from FY22 to FY24, the earnings CAGR is pegged around 14 per cent.

â€œRolling over our valuations to FY24E and trimming our forward PE valuation multiples amid rising rate hike scenario we now value the Nifty at 18,700 i.e. 20x PE on FY24E EPS of Rs 935,â€ ICICI Securities said.

2022-05-25,Can life insurers offer health plans? Irdai set to take a call,"Allowing life insurance companies to offer health plans is one of the big decisions in front of Irdai chairman Debasish Panda, who has vowed to simplify regulations and capital requirements and introduce new products to widen insurance penetration in the country.","iStockRelatedPrivate sector general insurers lead market share growth in AprilMotor insurers asked to stop ads displaying services not part of coverLIC makes muted debut, lists at 9% discount on stock exchangesMumbai: Six years after it banned life insurance companies from offering health insurance products, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) is mulling allowing it again as the new chairman is relooking at long-pending changes to enhance penetration of insurance in the country.

Allowing life insurance companies to offer health plans is one of the big decisions in front of Irdai chairman Debasish Panda, who has vowed to simplify regulations and capital requirements and introduce new products to widen insurance penetration in the country.



""Allowing life insurance companies to manufacture and distribute health plans has been a bone of contention in the industry because general and standalone health insurance companies are clearly opposed to it. But a decision will have to be made especially as a committee to evaluate this feasibility more than two years ago has submitted its report,"" said the CEO of a life insurance company.

The nine-member committee co-chaired by LIC chairman MR Kumar and former New India Assurance chairman G Srinivasan was formed in February 2020 to examine the feasibility and business scope for life insurance companies to offer indemnity-based health plans.

MORE STORIES FOR YOUâœ•Private sector general insurers lead market share growth in AprilMotor insurers asked to stop ads displaying services not part of coverLIC makes muted debut, lists at 9% discount on stock exchangesÂ« Back to recommendation storiesI don't want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMIT""The committee had sent its recommendation more than one-and-a-half years ago. But since the life insurance members were outnumbered in the committee, all it could suggest was allowing life insurance companies to be distributors of health plans, though the demand has always been to enable life insurers to offer health because it is a natural combination rather than clubbing it with general insurance products like motor,"" said a member of the committee.

Industry captains say a new chief at the Irdai along with the recent public listing of LIC could alter the status quo in the industry.

""The new Irdai chairman wants things to move. But more importantly, since now LIC is listed, it is in the government's interest to make sure it is profitable, and this is one way of doing it. Allowing LIC to offer health will open up a whole new segment, so the key is with the government. It is also important to see what are LIC's views on this since previously they have been reluctant to venture into new areas as they were always under pressure to fulfil the government mandate,"" said the CEO cited above.

Allowing life insurers to offer health plans will dent the fortunes of standalone health insurers and general insurance companies. The regulator will also have to take into account their complaints, especially at a time when there has been increased awareness of these products post-Covid.

A research paper by the National Insurance Academy released earlier this month said that health insurance premium collected has jumped to â‚¹73,330 crore in FY22 from â‚¹58,572 crore a year ago and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 24%.

""This has been a proposal which has been in the works but a decision has not been made yet. There are other issues which are also under consideration, so it is not as if this decision is next in line,"" said a senior Irdai official. The regulator could not be immediately reached for comment.

Among the proposed reforms in life insurance are the standardisation of products and simplifying regulations, more specifically on calculations of management expenses for these companies. 

""But this move is probably more important because it has ramifications throughout the insurance industry,"" said the CEO cited above.

It is unclear whether Irdai would want to take a fresh look at health insurance or will rely on already existing submissions by previous committees in this regard.

2022-06-17,PVs or 2-wheelers?

""We know that because of the semiconductor chip shortage, demand and growth have been muted but 2023 could be a very good year from that perspective,"" Khemani added.","AgenciesNEW DELHI: At a time when the market was rallying, auto sector sulked. And now, when the market is in total disarray, strength seems to have returned to auto counters, helped by healthy volumes and hopes of commodity benefits after the government moved to reduce steel prices.

The Nifty auto index trades flat, with a positive bias, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis as against a 13 per cent decline in the benchmark Nifty50.

Automobiles are a good trade which is building in especially from the recovery of volume perspective, said Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital Advisors. ""We know that because of the semiconductor chip shortage, demand and growth have been muted but 2023 could be a very good year from that perspective,"" Khemani added.
ETMarkets Smart Talk: Srikanth Subramanian decodes factors that could derail momentum on D-St
Auto index has underperformed the market for the last four years. Even now, semiconductor and supply chain issues linger but demand for automobiles remains strong, with a waiting period of three months to two years.

Industry experts suggest that healthy booking and single-digit cancellation show that demand may stay put even when normal supply resumes in months to come. This optimism is getting reflected in the share price movement of leading auto stocks.

M&M, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp are up 2-11 per cent in one month versus a 6 per cent fall in Nifty50. Bajaj Auto and Tata Motors though trade marginally in the red have managed to outperform.

""After many years of underperformance, we are seeing auto shares come back quite strongly. They are in a kind of blue sky scenario at this point in time. We have seen a clear-cut turnaround in their fortunes. At higher volumes and with this latest government move to reduce steel prices, a lot of the pressure on their operating profit margins will ease. Auto shares will likely come into the leadership position over the next several months and quarters,"" Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities told ET NOW.


Where to bet: PVs, CVs, 2Ws?While overall auto sector valuations look lucrative, analysts are leaning towards consumer-facing stocks, especially in the four-wheeler segment. The consensus view remains weak on two-wheelers.

Hemang Jani of Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects demand to improve for passenger vehicles (PVs) on the back of easing supply chain issues. However, he sees a slow recovery in 2-wheelers (2Ws).

Data pointed out that retail sales of passenger vehicles grew last month but the sales of two-wheelers and commercial vehicles remained low compared to the pre-Covid month of May 2019, according to automobile dealers' body federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). 

""While PV and tractors continued their positive run... two-wheeler, three-wheeler and CV sales are yet to show any signs of healthy run-rate,"" FADA President Vinkesh Gulati said in a statement.

Intense competition and the kind of disruption that may come from EVs does not make me optimistic on Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVs, said Dipan Mehta. Companies like Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti remain his top picks.

Contrarily, Edelweiss Research believes there is excessive pessimism in the case of 2Ws and some overconfidence on PVs and CVs, which is reflecting in the valuations. 

""Hence, we prefer 2Ws in the auto pack and have a â€˜BUYâ€™ on the three stocks in our coverage â€“ Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp,"" it said.


Headwinds to auto storyWhile the demand scenario is playing in favour of the auto stocks, tightening liquidity and slowing economic activity in the quarter could play a dampener.

""If the auto loan rates go up by 1.5-2 per cent, then the margin will impact demand to some extent because most of the four-wheelers are financed and that is the only challenge which some of these companies will face,"" independent market expert Sandip Sabharwal observed.

Top Q4 picks down up to 47% in 2022NEW DELHI â€“ For the last couple of years, a regime of record low-interest rates and massive central bank liquidity infusions have enabled equity investors to reap rich rewards from stock markets.

A combination of global shocks on the inflation front has now made it necessary for the Reserve Bank of India to start reversing ultra-loose monetary policy at a far quicker pace than was earlier estimated and stock markets have begun to feel the pinch.

Since the RBIâ€™s surprise off-policy rate hike last week, the BSE Sensex and the Nifty50 have lost more than 4 per cent and with the US Fed also aggressively hiking rates, navigating the current bout of market volatility is no easy task.

With the turn in the interest rate cycle and the removal of surplus liquidity from the banking system causing sovereign bond yields to shoot up to over-three-year highs, a theme that is repeatedly being discussed in markets is the valuation of equities.

â€œThe general rule of thumb is that the higher the risk-free rate of return, the higher is the discount rate that gets modelled into the DCF â€“ the discounted cash flow model based on which the fair value of any share is determined,â€ independent market analyst Ajay Bodke told ETMarkets.

Yields on government bonds represent the risk-free rate that prevails in the economy. So far in 2022, the yield on Indiaâ€™s 10-year bond yield has climbed 101 basis points and market watchers expect a much sharper rise in coming months as the RBI is seen hiking rates by around 100 basis points more.

â€œThere is a clear inverse correlation between the discount rate and the fair value of stocks, everything else being the same. There is also a concomitant de-rating in the valuation multiples ascribed by the market and so itâ€™s a double whammy,â€ Bodke said.

The market analyst warned that leveraged companies and those with large cash flows that are distant could be disproportionately impacted.

Consequently, so-called growth stocks, whose valuations factor in cash flows that are well into the future, could take a hit.

After having outperformed over the last 10 years, such â€˜growthâ€™ stocks could now have reached an inflection point and high-dividend yield stocks could return to favour, he said.

â€œSecondly, those companies whose business models were based on long-term â€˜storiesâ€™ where the market has not ascribed the value based on cash-flows or profits but based on high price-to-estimated sales or some other metric like gross value merchandise etc or some such esoteric metric, those will get disproportionately impacted.â€

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the surge in Indian government bond yields over the last few weeks has kept the yield gap at high levels despite a moderate correction in equity markets.

The brokerage said that while valuations are still high on an absolute basis for growth and quality large-cap and mid-cap stocks, they were starting to turn more reasonable through a combination of price and time correction over the past 7-8 months.

â€œValuations are quite reasonable for financials and â€˜valueâ€™ stocks,â€ Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Maintaining its overweight stance on RIL stock, global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has upgraded its target price to Rs 3,253, signaling about a 20 per cent upside in the counter.

Morgan Stanley's is the highest target for the scrip on the Street now, ET NOW suggested.

The foreign brokerage, which sees value creation potential from RIL's global pivot on energy security, said the current valuation implies zero value being assigned to the new energy business and sooner than later the market will start factoring it in the price.

The scrip climbed over 2 per cent to hit a high of Rs 2,776.40, commanding a m-cap just below $250 billion ($246 billion) at rupee-dollar exchange rate of 76.31. Shares of Reliance Industries are up by 8 per cent in the last five trading sessions. The bluechip stock has rallied about 16 per cent in the calendar year 2022 so far, compared to a 3 per cent fall in Sensex during the period.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate's market capitalization now makes it the 37th largest company in the world. RIL has raced past global behemoths like PepsiCo, Toyota, Alibaba, Walt Disney, Cisco and Verizon.

Morgan Stanley said energy security is a key issue for policymakers and believes hydrogen will play a major role in the upcoming energy transition of India.

Because of the heightened awareness of energy security in the country, RIL's new energy business is expected to benefit out of that, it said. The company's net asset value could be boosted by 10 per cent due to the new energy business, the brokerage said.

Given the fact that there is a tightness in the refining and gas market, the company's old energy business is expected to benefit and that could be funding half of the capital expenditure required for this energy business over the next three years.

Because of this the company's debt is expected to remain range bound, it said.

Earlier on April 13, domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal gave a buy rating to Reliance with a target price of Rs 2,880.

""We value the standalone segment at INR795/share, valuing it at 7.5x FY24E EV/EBITDA. We value Jio at 18x FY24E EV/EBITDA, contributing INR944/share. We value Retail at INR1,118/share, valuing the core segment at 37x FY24E EV/EBITDA and non-core at 4x,"" said the brokerage.

Even technical analysts have turned bullish on the stock.

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com, on Tuesday recommended to buy Reliance Industries with a short term target of Rs 2,780. ""The stock prices have formed a â€˜Higher Top Higher Bottomâ€™ structure from the recent swing lows on the daily chart,"" he said.

In the meantime, Reliance Jio has taken a lead over Bharti Airtel to become the country's second largest fixed-line service provider in February 2022, according to data published by the sector regulator TRAI. Dalal Street is also expecting RIL to pull off a strong show in the March 2022 quarter with improvement in gross refining margins (GRM).

Dixon Technologies: Sell| Target Rs 3,100| Stop Loss Rs 4,000The stock has given a breakout from the Head & Shoulder pattern formation on the long-term chart. The stock is trading below its 21, 50 & 200-days exponential moving averages and continues its losing streak for the third straight session suggesting further downside movement.

Prices are expected to find support near Rs 3,480, below this, we can expect further downward movement till the level of Rs 3,100 while Rs 4,000 will act as a crucial resistance level on the upside. 


GNFC: Buy| Target Rs 885| Stop Loss Rs 795The share price of Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals (GNFC) surged over 10% in morning trade after it reported quarterly numbers for Q4 March 2022.

On the technical front, the stock has formed a bullish continuation flag pattern on the daily chart and momentum oscillators such as RSI is headed upward which is bullish for the stock.


Asian Paints: Buy| Target Rs 3,280| Stop Loss Rs 3,000Prices surged over 4% in morning trade and broke the six-day losing trend on Tuesday ahead of the quarterly result. The company has reported a half a percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit.

A green candle followed by two indecision candles near to the support level suggests upward movement in prices.

Prices are sustaining below the 21, 50 & 200-days exponential moving averages, and if it manages to close above the same then a target towards Rs 3,130 is expected.

We expect a bull Run towards Rs 3,280 to Rs 3,400 levels in the near term.

 The purchases were made over the past week and cost about $529 million, Berkshire said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. These come on top of a $336 million share purchase by Berkshire last month in the oil company, and $7 billion in purchases earlier this year.

 Following the purchases, Berkshire now owns about 152.7 million Occidental shares worth about $8.52 billion based on Occidental stock's Wednesday close, which is down over 21% since it touched its year's high in May.

 However, Occidental's share prices are currently up over 90% this year, after more than doubling, as they benefited from Berkshire's purchases and rising oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

2022-05-23,Taking large cash calls is not as critical as it is perceived to be," Investors donâ€™t consciously calculate the difference in returns that their strategy (higher cash calls) generates but derive huge comfort and satisfaction when they are able to invest in market corrections. It â€˜feelsâ€™ like that strategy would generate superior returns given that we are buying during a market correction, but an accurate assessment of opportunity cost is not done.","Shutterstock.comOne of the issues investors often lament during a market correction is how they could not sell at highs and create enough cash to start investing during bear markets. It is an interesting thought, but in todayâ€™s column, I intend to debunk the notion that large cash calls are critical to wealth creation. I will submit that cash calls have more to do with behavioural aspects rather than their statistical benefits when juxtaposed against their opportunity cost. I will conclude that, as investors, we are far better off focusing on investible businesses and the price we should pay for them, rather than inordinately worrying about cash calls. If that interests you, please read on!

An important distinction here is about the fundamental fabric of the economy in which we are making these decisions. An economy does well over a long time when (a) more people work, and (b) people work more efficiently (labour force participation and productivity gains). With people, ideally, we should measure effectiveness, and not efficiency, but I digress. In India, more than 90 million people will join the labour force over the next decade, and we are continuously finding more ways to be efficient. Accordingly, the conclusions for Indiaâ€™s investments will be different from what has transpired in Japan over the past three decades.

Despite that, retail investors in India own just 8% of the market (16% including mutual funds), but that constitutes an even smaller percentage of their overall savings. For a vast majority of retail investors, stock markets are no longer considered akin to gambling casinos, but we are still far away from where equities are a must-have allocation in oneâ€™s savings.

Nevertheless, to this reading cohort, I donâ€™t have to enlist the benefits of equity as in an investible asset class, I will take it as a given. In that case, the only decision that we must make is regarding the approach. To me, using leverage is not sustainable as a universal strategy. Leverage makes us terribly path-dependent. If we buy a certain stock at 100 on leverage (the fair price of which we believe is 150), and the stock dips to 70 before it reaches 150, we might be forced to liquidate. We build an acceptable path (for leverage to sustain) based on what has happened in the past. But increasingly, things that have not happened in the past are happening all the time now (markets had never corrected 30% in a month before COVID, and no market recovery had happened in a straight line before 2021). And any strategy where ruin is a possible scenario, however low, the a priori probability is unlikely to yield long-term success across all practitioners (ergo, not a universal strategy. Works with a few, and we celebrate the winners. But those who leveraged and got wiped off, we donâ€™t know them!).

If Indiaâ€™s economy is on a strong fundamental foundation and equity as an asset class deserves allocation within our savings and leverage is not an alternative, the only question that remains to be answered is - should we always stay invested in the market, or keep getting in and out (either fully or partially â€“ aka, take large cash calls)?

The chart below compares the long-term returns of an investor who managed to invest all their surplus at the absolute market bottom (dark red bar) versus an investor who kept investing regularly (grey bar). Despite the huge market correction in the Global Financial Crises (light red bar), the difference in long-term returns of both investors is not material.

The higher value of the red bar over the grey bar is assuming that the investor can accurately time the market. The difference between the two bars then, is the benefit of cash calls, if you will. Now let us look at the costs. Over the last three decades (13,500 days), if an investor missed just the best 10 days of the market, the investor returns would have been 65% lower. Miss 30 days and returns fall by a whopping 92%.


ET CONTRIBUTORS
Put another way, if an investor absolutely nails the market bottom, the advantage he gains is minuscule compared to the costs (65% and 92% lower returns). The risks are not commensurate for marginally higher returns, in my opinion. Why then, one would wonder, would investors focus so hard on taking these cash calls?

I would submit that, for many, it is an emotional issue. Investors donâ€™t consciously calculate the difference in returns that their strategy (higher cash calls) generates but derive huge comfort and satisfaction when they are able to invest in market corrections. It â€˜feelsâ€™ like that strategy would generate superior returns given that we are buying during a market correction, but an accurate assessment of opportunity cost is not done.

I would propose a different approach to cash calls. Rather than letting it be an input parameter ('markets are expensive, so letâ€™s create cashâ€™), let cash be an output of articulated actions. For us, a good business is a great investment only when we pay the right price for it. Admittedly, there are different ways to arrive at the â€œright priceâ€ (we use reverse discounted cash flows), but when the price of the businesses we own gets too high, and we do not get decent businesses to buy, thatâ€™s when the cash percentage should increase. If that coincides with markets topping out, so be it. This approach will ensure an investorâ€™s mental bandwidth is utilized in arriving at the right business to own, and the right price to pay versus incessantly worrying about market movement and behaviour.

2022-04-02,The case for big Fed rate hikes just got a little stronger,"Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate fell after the jobs report, as expectations intensified that the Fed will go bigger at next month's meeting and again in June, hiking by a half-a-percentage point each time to deal a more decisive blow to price pressures.","AgenciesRate futures contracts reflect odds-on bets for the policy rate to end the year in the range of 2.5% to 2.75%, with about a one-in-three chance of going even higher.It's not as if US central bankers needed more reasons to step up the pace of interest rate hikes.

But that's what they got on Friday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest jobs report showed employers added 431,000 to payrolls last month and the unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.6%. All are signs of a strong labor market with little need for the kind of super-easy monetary policy that the Fed is currently delivering and has begun to unwind.

Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate fell after the jobs report, as expectations intensified that the Fed will go bigger at next month's meeting and again in June, hiking by a half-a-percentage point each time to deal a more decisive blow to price pressures.

Rate futures contracts reflect odds-on bets for the policy rate to end the year in the range of 2.5% to 2.75%, with about a one-in-three chance of going even higher. Either way that is high enough to put the brakes on growth.

It was just two weeks ago that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point in its first policy tightening in three years, and signaled ongoing rate hikes ahead to rein in inflation at a 40-year high and climbing.

Investment RationalePVRâ€™s Q4FY22 cash EBITDA loss was at Rs341mn largely due to lower advertising (ad) and other revenues. However, average ticket price (ATP) has positively surprised with increase of 1.3% QoQ to Rs242, and the company is confident of sustaining it. Spending per head on food and beverages (SPH) though has dipped 5.4% QoQ, but remains strong at Rs122. Film hire charges (%) was slightly lower than INOXâ€™s, but management has guided to achieve pre-covid levels in FY23. The guidance of 126 new screen openings is strong due to imminent handover of pent-up sites, and commencement of operations therein w.e.f. H2FY23. PVR is excited about the currently strong movie pipeline. Recent successes of dubbed Hindi content increase the addressable box office market in India. Ad revenues are crucial for profitability, and the company expects the same to normalise in 3-4 months. It raises EBITDA estimates by 10-30% over FY23E-FY24E as we increase our ATP assumption. Accordingly, it increases target price to Rs1,965 (from Rs1,804) and cut EV/EBITDA multiple to 15x (from 16x) to bring parity with INOX.

The equity markets had an overall positive week, but the broad sentiment remained quite tentative as the Nifty oscillated both ways during the five trading sessions before ending on a positive note. 

The index saw itself breaking out of the 16400-15700 trading range which is broad enough in its own way; however, it suffered a throwback and consolidated again in a narrow range. 

ET CONTRIBUTORSThe trading range also remained a bit narrow; against the 511-point range in the week before this one, the Nifty oscillated in a lesser, 355-point range.

While largely staying positive, the index did not take any major step higher. The headline Nifty50 closed with a net gain of 231.85 points (+1.42%) on a weekly basis.

From the technical perspective, the breakout above 16400 levels has made this level the immediate support level for the Nifty in the near term. Besides this, the Nifty so far has held the double bottom formed near the immediate low point of this range. The most immediate resistance that the index has is the 50-week MA which presently stands at 17056; this again makes the zone of 16400-17000 yet another trading zone for the index. 
Apart from this, volatility too declined during the week; INDIA VIX came off by 7.01% to 19.98.

The coming week stays crucial for the markets. The index trades in a narrow trading zone; it will require a comprehensive push above the 17000 levels. The levels of 16700 and 16950 will act as immediate resistance levels; the supports are expected to come in at 16520 and 16380 levels.

The weekly RSI is 46.47; it shows a mild bullish divergence against the price. 

The weekly MACD is bearish and stays below the signal line. A spinning top emerged on the candles; this shows the tentative and indecisive behavior of the market participants. 

The pattern analysis shows that the Index trades below the 50-Week MA which stands at 17056. However, it trades above the 200-, and the 100-Week MAs. 
The move towards the 50-Week MA will also take the index to a very important pattern resistance; this pattern resistance is the trendline that was violated by Nifty on its way down. 

All in all, we may continue seeing the markets trading tentatively. It is largely expected that the markets will continue to stay highly stock-specific in nature.
We may see isolated stock-specific outperformance from all the sectors rather than any particular sector dominating during the week. It would be extremely important to stay with the right kind of stock. It is recommended that the focus should be to avoid shorts and make use of the dips, if any, to make entries in stocks that are showing improvement in their relative strength. We can expect a good show from pockets like Energy, PSE, Consumption, IT, etc. over the coming days.
In our look at Relative Rotation GraphsÂ®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (NIFTY 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed.

The analysis of Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) shows some pockets losing strength in terms of their momentum against the broader markets. The Metal Index has drifted further lower inside the weakening quadrant. Besides this, the Realty Index that had rolled inside the improving quadrant in the previous week has sharply lost its relative momentum and has rolled back inside the lagging quadrant. We may see these pockets relatively underperforming the broader Nifty500 Index.
The Nifty Consumption, FMCG, Infrastructure, Pharma, PSE, Commodities, and the Midcap 100 indexes are inside the leading quadrant. However, few among these groups are seen slightly giving up on their relative momentum against the broader markets.

Nifty Media has rolled back inside the weakening quadrant; PSU Bank continues to stay in the weakening quadrant as well.

Nifty Services sector and Nifty IT indexes stay inside the lagging quadrant. These pockets may see relative underperformance against the broader markets but some stock-specific shows from these groups may not be ruled out.

Both Bank Nifty and Financial Services indexes have rolled inside the improving quadrant.

Investment RationaleKarur Vysya Bank (KVB) reported a significant beat on estimates, led by better NIMs and lower credit cost (1.1% annualised). Asset quality improved, with GNPA at ~6%, led by negative net slippages, while the restructured pool remained largely steady at ~2.8% of loans. Overall loan growth (+9% YoY) was driven by commercial (+12%), agri (+13%) and home loans (+9%). KVB is incrementally focused on driving granular growth (LAP, commercial banking, and other retail) and has guided for a 12% loan growth in FY23. With a steady NIM trajectory and improving line of sight on lower credit costs, KVB is wellplaced to inch closer to its ~1% RoA target. We trim our FY23/FY24E earnings estimates by 1%/3% to factor in lower loan growth, partly offset by lower credit costs. Maintain ADD with a revised TP of INR63

In a report on Monday, Jefferies indicated that all-India average cement prices fell 3% in May compared to the previous month as prices in several markets declined due to weak demand. ""Downward risk on earnings estimates has resurfaced as price hikes are not sustaining and costs remain elevated,"" said Jefferies. The brokerage said cement price rises in the northern, eastern and central regions of India in April were robust but a partial rollback of the increase in May is concerning.

We forecast FY23 industry demand growth of 7% year-on-year and profitability to fall 13% year-on-year,"" said CLSA.

The brokerage sees uncertainty for cement companies in the near term because of elevated costs and price competition but it also believes that the sector could be on the verge of another round of consolidation with the Adani Group taking over Ambuja and ACC. UltraTech is CLSA's top cement sector pick.

ACC shares ended flat at â‚¹2,138.10 on Tuesday while that of Ambuja ended down 0.45% at â‚¹363.30. UltraTech shares ended 0.5% lower at â‚¹5,554.60.

One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.","PTIICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank and Bank of India are among the leading local lenders that Thursday raised their external reference benchmarks, used largely for pricing retail loans, a day after Reserve Bank of India increased its key rate for the second time in as many months to restrain inflation. About half of the country's outstanding banking credit is linked to external rates.

These banks raised their respective external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) by 50 basis points (bps), matching the latest increase in the repo, or the rate at which RBI lends short-term funds to commercial banks. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

ICICI Bank's EBLR now stands at 8.6%, up from 8.1% before. ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate (I-EBLR) is referenced to the RBI policy repo rate, with a mark-up over the repo rate,"" the bank said on its web site.


Retail Loans Linked to EBLR 
 Public sector lender Bank of Baroda said its EBLR rate now stands at 7.4%, effective June 9. 

""Just like they had declined sharply, rates will normalise in a similar manner,"" said Sanjiv Chadha, MD, Bank of Baroda. ""EBLR-linked loans are 30-35% of our portfolio."" 

At Bank of Baroda, about 40% of the loans are linked to an internal reference gauge, or the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR). ""In MCLR, the increase will be more gradual because it is linked to the deposit costs, which will rise depending on how the liquidity situation moves,"" said Chadha.




All banks will automatically pass on the entire repo rate increase to customers that borrowed funds linked to external benchmarks. In the case of loans priced on MCLR or a 'fixed' rate, the asset liability committees of the respective banks are expected to decide on the quantum of increase in loan costs.

More than 40% of all outstanding bank loans are linked to the EBLR currently, and another 30% are linked to MCLR. The remaining are fixed-rate loans. All fresh retail and MSME loans are linked to EBLR, while corporate loans are linked to MCLR.

Public sector lender Punjab National Bank said its repo-linked lending rate will be 7.4%, effective June 9. Bank of India also revised its rates 50 bps higher to 7.75%. The Central Bank and RBL Bank, too, raised their EBLRs.

Separately, Kotak Mahindra Bank announced a rise in its interest rates on savings accounts and fixed deposits. Daily balances in savings accounts above Rs 50 lakh will earn 50 basis points higher - or 4%. 

 Rates on fixed deposits have been increased in the range of 10 to 25 basis points. Mortgage lender HDFC too announced an increase in its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) on housing loans by 50 basis points with effect from June 10. Its home loans now start from 7.55%.


Immediate Transmission

""EBLR will move in tandem with the entire regulatory movement. Since retail loans are linked to EBLR, the transmission will happen,"" said Shanti Ekambaram, Group President - Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""It's clear that we will see another few rounds of rate hikes, which could take the repo rate to 5.5%-6%. The market rates have gone up much sharper; so we felt that our savers should also get reasonable returns."" 

On Tuesday, private lender HDFC Bank increased its MCLR by 35 basis points across loan tenors, making loans expensive for existing borrowers. The new MCLR will now range between 7.5% and 8.05%. The one-year MCLR rate stands at 7.85%.

Analysts tracking the stock said, adjusted for recovery and upgrades, net slippages were negative for the third straight quarter and said an expansion in net interest margin (NIM) is likely ahead, given the bank has three-fourth of its loan book under floating rate.

Calling the stock 'attractively valued' they have price targets that hint at up to 56 per cent upside for the counter.

Loan growth surprised positively and this improvement will be the key catalyst for the stock, said Nomura India, which has a target of Rs 615 on the stock. 

CLSA said the prevailing SBI valuations are undemanding, adding that SBI remains one of its top picks in the banking sector. Credit cost continues to undershoot it said, as the brokerage set a target of Rs 660 on the stock.

The PSU bank reported a 41.27 per cent YoY jump in standalone net profit at Rs 9,113.53 crore for March quarter, up from Rs 6,450.75 crore in the year ago quarter.

NIM was stable sequentially at 3.12 per cent.

Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 3.97 per cent of the total assets, down from 4.50 sequentially and 4.98 per cent year-on-year.

Prabhudas Lillaldher said, like most large private peers, recoveries exceeded slippages leading to lower gross NPAs. Balance sheet, it said, is stronger than ever with a high provision coverage ratio at 75 per cent, minimal stress and adequate coverage on one-time restructuring (OTR) pool.

""While loan growth was stronger, credit flow was largely led by corporate due to better utilisation levels. Credit is guided to grow by 12 per cent YoY in FY23 although, NIM would keenly watch,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said while suggesting a target of Rs 600.

IIFL Securities said SBI's pre-provision operating profit was in line with estimates but profit was 6 per cent above estimates led by lower provisions. Operationally, the quarter for SBI trended largely on expected lines, with 6 per cent QoQ loan growth, stable margins and continued improvement in asset quality, it said.

The brokerage finds valuations are attractive at 0.9 times FY24 core book value and has a target of Rs 710 on the stock.

The stock traded 2.48 per cent higher at Rs 456.10. At this price, a IIFLs Rs 710 target suggests a potential 56 per cent upside while PL's Rs 600 target suggests a potential 31 per cent upside. 

For Axis Securities, SBI is Rs 665 worthy. ICICI Securities finds it worth Rs 673.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said the brokerage's key operational metrics were strong, with overall loan book growing 11.6 per cent YoY and 6 per cent sequentially.

Retail and corporate both saw healthy and sustainable traction on the back of pick-up in market demand, it said, adding that pick-up in the utilisation levels in the wholesale segment augurs well from the growth standpoint.

""With 74 per cent of the loan book on floating rate, we see margins on a positive trajectory going forward. Asset quality continued to improve, with NPAs declining sequentially and satisfactory performance on accounts coming out of moratorium. Credit cost for FY22 stood at 94 bps and the bank would like to contain it within 100 bps going forward. We maintain our ROE estimate of 14.5-15 per cent and reiterate SBI as one of our top picks,"" it said while suggesting a target of Rs 626.
